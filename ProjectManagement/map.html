<span xsmall>Describing/Modeling systems</span>
- Describe system as a graph.
  Nodes are components/actors then:
  - graph 1: Arrows are relations. 
  - graph 2: Arrows are data flows. (map to sequence diagrams).

- Describe actors (components, users, roles..) and the frequent task
  each actor will be in charge of. 


- Classify entities in model according to:
  -ºactive entitiesº: entities that initiate a new work flow that acts as
     "beeings with own will". In software those entities are related to human 
     users, IoT devices, ... 
     In general, they must registrer and authenticate "shomehow" to the 
     system, have a set of assigned secrets/signature keys/... and represent
     natural/legal entities. Ex:
  -ºreactive-entitiesº: entities that react to external orders/requests.
     The mostly corresponds to software modules like daemons, 
     modules exposing REST APIs, ...
  -ºdata entitiesº: persistence data representing the status of the software model.
    They can be subdivided in:
    - Business entities: entities modeling the "Happy path" in a business workflow.
    
    - Error control : entities modeling the "Non-Happy path" when workflow
                      is stuck pending some data/event or must rollback due to
                      some non-contemplated/non-fixable error/condition.
      They can be subdivided in:
      - Error origin     : Explain where or why the error originated
      - Error destination: Explains who must fix the error.
      - Error metadata   : Extra information about the error that can
                           help to fix/audit/trace the error.

""" 
   Next time you find yourself Googling some cool new technology to 
   (re)build your architecture around, I urge you to stop and follow 
  ºUNPHATºinstead:

  - Don't even start considering solutions until you <b>U</b>nderstand the 
    problem. Your goal should be to "solve" the problem mostly within the 
    problem domain, not the solution domain.
  - e<b>N</b>umerate multiple candidate solutions. Don't just start prodding 
    at your favorite!
  - Consider a candidate solution, then read the <b>P</b>aper if there is 
    one.
  - Determine the <b>H</b>istorical context in which the candidate solution 
    was designed or developed.
  - Weigh <b>A</b>dvantages against disadvantages. Determine what was 
    de-prioritized to achieve what was prioritized.
  - <b>T</b>hink! Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your 
    problem. What fact would need to be different for you to change your 
    mind? For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before 
    youd elect not to use Hadoop?

  <span xsmall>MoSCoW Task Prioritization</span>
  MoSCoW method  is  one  of  the  most  used  prioritization  
techniques  in  the  project  management  and software development 
and for this reason it was selected in the current deliverable. 

  Its primary role is to define a common baseline with partners on how 
they evaluate (e.g. most important/important/least important/etc.) 
each defined requirement. 

The acronym, MoSCoW, stands for 4 categories of prioritizations:
• "Must  have" requirements are considered vital/critical for the partner in order 
  to obtain a successful  outcome.  As  a  result,  these  are  
  considered  non-negotiable  and  mandatory. Furthermore,  any 
  solution delivered withouta requirement tagged as a must is not 
  considered viable.  If a workaround can be found for a requirement, 
  then this is not considered as “Musthave”. 

• "Should have" requirements:
  This  type comprises   all requirements that are not considered vital 
  but are important for the partner. The solution is considered viable 
  even if the requirement is not met. A workaround can be employed and 
  the solution will remain viable.

• "Could have" :
  contains all the  desired  features  that  could improve  the  
  functionality/work  experience  of the  solution  but  do  not  
  affect  the  result.  These  requirements have a minimum impact on 
  the end goal and are usually firstlyremoved in case of limited 
  timeframes.  

• "Won’t have" : (this time)
  requirements that are not needed at the current time or which do not 
  bring any addition to the value of the desired solution. Such 
  requirements do not have priority at the current moment of time. 

BºAccording  to  literature,  this prioritization  method  is        º
Bºefficient  and  offers  better  results  when  compared  to simplerº
Bºprioritizations approaches like high/medium/low prioritization or  º
Bºsequential prioritization.                                         º

- Projects takes too much (1 year taking requirements, 10 months
  developping,...)

- Agile applies to project, people relationships,...
  prioritization of tasks, ...  better visibility,
  better prioritization, less downtime between tasks,
  Improved teamwork

- What's a task:
  A case study / promo-video / market-research /... ? NO. Too long.
  A task in agile is something that takes more than 30 minutes and less 
  than 3 days.

- How to estimate the time?
  Estimating is hard.
  Use story points (vs hours):
      1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48
      This could map (not necesarely) to:
      30min, 1hour, 2hours, 4hours, 1day, 2days, 3days.

SCRUM vs KANBAN: 
  Both are subsets of Agile.
  SCRUM targets dead-lines. (fixed dates)
   * Releases are more important that "what's in".
   * Delay release or drop feature?
   * Uses a PLAN MODE

  Kanban:
   * Service team. new tickets  always comming in.
   * Prioritazing the tickets (tasks) and doing in the right order
     is more important than how many are done in a week.
   * No Plan mode, no Sprints. 
     PLAN MODE:
   * Do NOT uses a PLAN MODE

<span xsmall>Why I hate Scrum</span>
https://dzone.com/articles/why-i-hate-scrum?edition=618291
By Gerhard Beck

I’ll define Scrum as the methodology developed by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland and documented in “The Scrum Guide.”

opinion: Scrum is not agile and, in practice, not very flexible. 

- Let’s take a look at the basic terminology:
  - "daily scrum"
    (less sporty and a lot less aggressive: a daily standup)
    - what you did.
    - what you are going to do
    - blockers. 
  - "sprints": management metaphor  to pressure to work un-paid hours.
    - 2 hours "sprints": "Put more pressure"

  - "Done" Scrum meaning.
     It starts with requiring those “performing the work and those inspecting
     the resulting increment must share a common definition of ‘Done’."
     - Problem: "done" depends:
                - on the task to be accomplished. 
                - on customer acceptance.
                -Dificult to figure out.
     - going to "done" must NOT be "insane"
     - ‘Done’ increment required at the Sprint Review. (just another way
       to put more preassure).

  - Time box: (2 weeks)
    Idea   : fit everything into "time box" so we all finish together.
    Reality: some things go faster, some others go slower.
           - Scrum is not agile, it’s a two-week waterfall from hell.

  - Scrum Master:
    Idea   : servant-leader for the Scrum Team.
    Reality: project manager stripped of the ability to manage the project.
     - "something needs to be done and a project manager can make the changes
        and get it done".
     - Scrum Master has to meekly explain to leadership that the next
       opportunity to save the ship will come in a week-and-a-half at
       the next sprint review
  
  - four formal events defined:
    - Sprint Planning
    - Daily Scrum:  replace with daily standup
    - Sprint Review
    - Sprint Retrospective: Do when needed, not at sprint plans.

    Reality: Waste of time for non-productive meeting. 

  - "team": 
     well-performing team members covering for poor performing team members
     is a guarantee that those will performing team members will soon be 
     working for a different company and you will have self-selected
     poor-quality team members. 
     Theory: 1-vote-per-team member:
     Reality: seasoned expert with thirty years of experience 
              outvoted by the novices.

  Conclusion:
  Perhaps as an industry we should work more on what a good leader looks like
  than trying to invent methodologies that deliberately remove leaders and 
  leadership as a quality. To me it seems entirely rudderless. 
  Scrum is Not a Team Player 

  Scrum is based around dropping working software every two weeks. 
  For some projects (web front ends) a short identical cadence works 
  well. For other projects (avionics) it doesn’t work at all.

Features:
- Jira Issues and Dashboards
- Agile concepts
- Jira Agile Plan, Work, Track

JIRA WORKFLOW SUMMARIZED:
  - We have a team of developers than pass the work to the QA Team that
  pass the work back to the developers or forwards it to the client,...
  - There can be "millions" of different workflows.


JIRA ISSUES and DASHBOARDS:
   - Dashboards allows for example to follow  others people work.

<span xsmall>Diagram Types</span>
Term                Meaning
Functional diagram  Structured representation of the functions (activities,
                    actions, processes, operations) within the system or one of its parts.
                    The model aims at facilitating the identification of 
                    information needs and helping to recognize opportunities.
                    Amongst other funct. diagrams include:
                    - Data Flow Diagram
                    - Sequence  Diagram

Component diagram   Diagram which has the purpose of representing the 
                    internal structure of the software system modeled in terms of its main 
                    components and the relationships between them. 
                    A component is a software unit with a distinct 
                    identity, as well as a distinct responsibility and 
                    well-defined interfaces.

Deployment diagram  Diagram which describes a system in terms of hardware 
                    resources, nodes, and relationships between them.
                    Often there is a diagram showing how the software 
                    components are distributed in the available hardware resources on the system.
                    In essence, it shows the physical location (deployment) of components of the architecture

Activity diagram    The process view is a way of showing what the system does at a high level 
                    from a process prospective, explaining how the small 
                    steps within the process fit together, in terms of 
                    order and information flow.

Use case diagram    Diagram representing the actors outside of a system 
                    capable of interacting with the system itself. It represents the highest 
                    level view of a system.  
                    Shows the system as a whole and its input and output to and from external elements.

<span title>Advanced Search (CQL)</span>
@[https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/#cql-operators]
CQL stands for Confluence Query Language (CQL)

Simple CQL:  $field $operator (value|function)1+ 

Ex.: space = "TEST" ← find all content in "TEST" space. 

Rº:It is not possible to compare two fieldsº

Content API REST Resource Ex:
AAA="-u username:password"
curl $AAA    "$BASE_URL/rest/api/content/search?cql=space=TEST" ← Simple query

COMPLEX_QUERY=""
COMPLEX_QUERY="$COMPLEX_QUERY cql=(type=page and space=DEV) OR"
COMPLEX_QUERY="$COMPLEX_QUERY (creator=admin and type=blogpost)"
curl $AAA -G "$BASE_URL/context/rest/api/content/search" \      ← Complex query
  --data-urlencode "$COMPLEX_QUERY" \
  | python -m json.tool 

Operators
CONTAINS: UsesºLucene's text-searchingº on fields:
          - title
          - text
          - space.title

AND|NOT: combine multiple clauses

Exs: 
              type  = "blogpost"      and    ← page|blogspot|attachment
             label  = "performance"   and

             - Commercial/Open-source; Needed to assess if any OOSS
               license prohibtis commercialization of final product

Inputs     : - Raw data files (e,g CSV, DBF,...)
             - Online data streams (e.g, Twitter API)
             - Structured data (JSON, XML, protobuff,...)
             - ...

<pre zoom labels="TODO">
<span xsmall>Error Management</span>
- Define generic "messages" to indicate "throws".
- Classify errors by:
  - Retry now   (weird conditions,...).
  - Retry later.
  - Do not retry.
- Classify errors by:
  - Internal to be fixed by Admins
  - Internal to be developers ("asserts in code")
  - External (to be fixed by users -or software-) sending 
    the input. In this case, most probably retry doesn't
    makes sense until client fixes its issues.

Rº*1 WARN, WARN,  WARN:º
  NOTE that the Risk column can weight more than the Estimation column
  in context with high uncertainty as we switch from industrialized
  (automated repetitive tasks) to development of new Software Solutions
  with non-scoped definition about Use-stories, technology stack,...
  Since software is easy to industrialize, many projects fall under the
  second alternative and so Risks must be taken as reference over
  estimations.

- Exploitation: The utilisation of results in further research activities 
  other than those covered by the action concerned, or in developing, 
  creating and marketing a product or process, or in creating and 
  providing a service, or in standardisation activities.*

  - But why does Dissemination/Explotation not always happen? 
    or barriers to effective D&E in projects
    o Perceiving dissemination and exploitation as "tick boxes", not 
      important for the "real work" of the project
    o Confusion between communication, dissemination, 
      exploitation. Focusing on implementing and validating technical 
      objectives instead of aligning work with the needs of users and 
      stakeholders.
    o Limited considerations of what can be valuable key results of 
      the project.
    o Lack of skills (or interest) to effectively consider the value 
      and possible benefits of the key results outside "typical" 
      community.
    o Lack of knowledge of dissemination and exploitation risks and 
      opportunities, alternative channels and routes, stakeholders, 
      competing solutions.
    o Lack of reflection and joint discussions within the consortia

<span xsmall>Decision Model and Notation</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Model_and_Notation]

See also Goldman Sach implementation in Java:
@[https://github.com/goldmansachs/jdmn]

Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard published by the Object Management Group.[1] It is a standard approach for describing and modeling repeatable decisions within organizations to ensure that decision models are interchangeable across organizations.

The DMN standard provides the industry with a modeling notation for decisions that will support decision management and business rules. The notation is designed to be readable by business and IT users alike. This enables various groups to effectively collaborate in defining a decision model:

- the business people who manage and monitor the decisions
- the business analysts or functional analysts who document the 
  initial decision requirements and specify the detailed decision 
  models and decision logic,
- the technical developers responsible for the automation of systems that make the decisions.

- The DMN standard can be effectively used standalone but it is also 
  complementary to the BPMN and CMMN standards. BPMN defines a special 
  kind of activity, the Business Rule Task, which "provides a mechanism 
  for the process to provide input to a business rule engine and to get 
  the output of calculations that the business rule engine might 
  provide"[2][3] that can be used to show where in a BPMN process a 
  decision defined using DMN should be used.

- DMN has been made a standard for Business Analysis according to BABOK v3.[4][5]

<span xsmall>CalVer.org</span>
CalVer is a versioning convention based on your project's release 
calendar, instead of arbitrary numbers.

Versioning gets better with time.

For maintainers, versioning allows us to specify precise dependencies 
within an ever-expanding ecosystem. For sellers and promoters, a 
project's version is a dynamic part of a brand. For all of us, 
versioning lets us reference the past while upgrading to the future.

Different projects use different systems for versioning, but common 
practices have emerged. For instance, point-separated numbers (e.g., 
3.1.4) are all but given. Another common versioning pattern 
incorporates a time-based element, usually part of the release date.

This date-based approach has come to be called Calendar Versioning, 
or CalVer for short.
