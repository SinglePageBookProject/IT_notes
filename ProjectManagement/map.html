@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development]

BDD suggests that unit test names be whole sentences starting with a 
conditional verb ("should" in English for example) and should be 
written in order of business value.

Acceptance tests should be written using the standard agile 
framework of a user story:

  -ºreactive-entitiesº: entities that react to external orders/requests.
     The mostly corresponds to software modules like daemons, 
     modules exposing REST APIs, ...
  -ºdata entitiesº: persistence data representing the status of the software model.
    They can be subdivided in:
    - Business entities: entities modeling the "Happy path" in a business workflow.
    
    - Error control : entities modeling the "Non-Happy path" when workflow
                      is stuck pending some data/event or must rollback due to
                      some non-contemplated/non-fixable error/condition.
      They can be subdivided in:
      - Error origin     : Explain where or why the error originated
      - Error destination: Explains who must fix the error.
      - Error metadata   : Extra information about the error that can

<span xsmall>MoSCoW Task Prioritization</span>
  MoSCoW method  is  one  of  the  most  used  prioritization  
techniques  in  the  project  management  and software development 
and for this reason it was selected in the current deliverable. 

  Its primary role is to define a common baseline with partners on how 
they evaluate (e.g. most important/important/least important/etc.) 
each defined requirement. 

The acronym, MoSCoW, stands for 4 categories of prioritizations:
• "Must  have" requirements are considered vital/critical for the partner in order 
  to obtain a successful  outcome.  As  a  result,  these  are  
  considered  non-negotiable  and  mandatory. Furthermore,  any 
  solution delivered withouta requirement tagged as a must is not 
  considered viable.  If a workaround can be found for a requirement, 
  then this is not considered as “Musthave”. 

• "Should have" requirements:
  This  type comprises   all requirements that are not considered vital 
  but are important for the partner. The solution is considered viable 
  even if the requirement is not met. A workaround can be employed and 
  the solution will remain viable.

• "Could have" :
  contains all the  desired  features  that  could improve  the  
  functionality/work  experience  of the  solution  but  do  not  
  affect  the  result.  These  requirements have a minimum impact on 
  the end goal and are usually firstlyremoved in case of limited 
  timeframes.  

• "Won’t have" : (this time)
  requirements that are not needed at the current time or which do not 
  bring any addition to the value of the desired solution. Such 
  requirements do not have priority at the current moment of time. 

BºAccording  to  literature,  this prioritization  method  is        º
Bºefficient  and  offers  better  results  when  compared  to simplerº
Bºprioritizations approaches like high/medium/low prioritization or  º
Bºsequential prioritization.                                         º

- Projects takes too much (1 year taking requirements, 10 months
  developping,...)

- Agile applies to project, people relationships,...
  prioritization of tasks, ...  better visibility,
  better prioritization, less downtime between tasks,
  Improved teamwork

- What's a task:
  A case study / promo-video / market-research /... ? NO. Too long.
  A task in agile is something that takes more than 30 minutes and less 
  than 3 days.

- How to estimate the time?
  Estimating is hard.
  Use story points (vs hours):
      1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48
      This could map (not necesarely) to:
      30min, 1hour, 2hours, 4hours, 1day, 2days, 3days.

SCRUM vs KANBAN: 
  Both are subsets of Agile.
  SCRUM targets dead-lines. (fixed dates)
   * Releases are more important that "what's in".
   * Delay release or drop feature?
   * Uses a PLAN MODE

  Kanban:
   * Service team. new tickets  always comming in.
   * Prioritazing the tickets (tasks) and doing in the right order
     is more important than how many are done in a week.
   * No Plan mode, no Sprints. 
     PLAN MODE:
   * Do NOT uses a PLAN MODE

<span xsmall>Why I hate Scrum</span>
https://dzone.com/articles/why-i-hate-scrum?edition=618291
By Gerhard Beck

I’ll define Scrum as the methodology developed by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland and documented in “The Scrum Guide.”

opinion: Scrum is not agile and, in practice, not very flexible. 

- Let’s take a look at the basic terminology:
  - "daily scrum"
    (less sporty and a lot less aggressive: a daily standup)
    - what you did.
    - what you are going to do
    - blockers. 
  - "sprints": management metaphor  to pressure to work un-paid hours.
    - 2 hours "sprints": "Put more pressure"

  - "Done" Scrum meaning.
     It starts with requiring those “performing the work and those inspecting
     the resulting increment must share a common definition of ‘Done’."
     - Problem: "done" depends:
                - on the task to be accomplished. 
                - on customer acceptance.
                -Dificult to figure out.
     - going to "done" must NOT be "insane"
     - ‘Done’ increment required at the Sprint Review. (just another way
       to put more preassure).

  - Time box: (2 weeks)
    Idea   : fit everything into "time box" so we all finish together.
    Reality: some things go faster, some others go slower.
           - Scrum is not agile, it’s a two-week waterfall from hell.

  - Scrum Master:
    Idea   : servant-leader for the Scrum Team.
    Reality: project manager stripped of the ability to manage the project.
     - "something needs to be done and a project manager can make the changes
        and get it done".
     - Scrum Master has to meekly explain to leadership that the next
       opportunity to save the ship will come in a week-and-a-half at
       the next sprint review
  
  - four formal events defined:
    - Sprint Planning
    - Daily Scrum:  replace with daily standup
    - Sprint Review
    - Sprint Retrospective: Do when needed, not at sprint plans.

    Reality: Waste of time for non-productive meeting. 

  - "team": 
     well-performing team members covering for poor performing team members
     is a guarantee that those will performing team members will soon be 
     working for a different company and you will have self-selected
     poor-quality team members. 
     Theory: 1-vote-per-team member:
     Reality: seasoned expert with thirty years of experience 
              outvoted by the novices.

  Conclusion:
  Perhaps as an industry we should work more on what a good leader looks like
  than trying to invent methodologies that deliberately remove leaders and 
  leadership as a quality. To me it seems entirely rudderless. 
  Scrum is Not a Team Player 

  Scrum is based around dropping working software every two weeks. 
  For some projects (web front ends) a short identical cadence works 
  well. For other projects (avionics) it doesn’t work at all.

<hr/>
<span title>Avoid "Product Owner" role</span>
- product owner role: proxy in between people doing the work and people 
  needing the job done, and this causes delays, misunderstandings and 
  bloat in our software engineering process.
  Poppendieck, author of many books on Lean in Software

- there is an emerging theme in the literature, namely that the 
  original balance of scrum master, product owner and team roles are 
  being adapted, conﬂated, and possibly corrupted, to suit the needs 
  of Bºorganizations transitioning from waterfall...º

- Summarising ... as we scale Agile and its usage becomes the norm,
  the product owner role may not be such an obvious need or an obvious
  fit to the situation.

 - CreateºIssue listº                                ← STEP 1

 - organize via EPICs.                               ← Optional

 - Move list to backlog  ("future TODO list")        ← STEP 2
   (TODOs planned, some of them can start 
    two years from now)

 - Decide if we need EPICs. (Team of work/tasks)     ← STEP 3

 - Create newºSPRINTº(batch of tasks) and decide     ← STEP 4
   which tasks to move from the backlog to the
   SPRINT TODO 
   (ussually two weeks dead-line).
   For every sprint we can decide to move forward 
   one or more epics.

 - create versions.                                  ← STEP 5 Optional

<pre zoom labels="versioning,TODO">
<span xsmall>CalVer.org</span>
- CalVer is a versioning convention based on your project's release 
  calendar, instead of arbitrary numbers.

_ Versioning gets better with time.

- For maintainers, versioning allows us to specify precise dependencies 
  within an ever-expanding ecosystem. For sellers and promoters, a 
  project's version is a dynamic part of a brand. For all of us, 
  versioning lets us reference the past while upgrading to the future.

- Different projects use different systems for versioning, but common 
  practices have emerged. For instance, point-separated numbers (e.g., 
  3.1.4) are all but given. Another common versioning pattern 
  incorporates a time-based element, usually part of the release date.

- This date-based approach has come to be called Calendar Versioning, 
  or CalVer for short.

<span xsmall>Diagram Types</span>
  Term                Meaning
OºFunctional diagramº Structured representation of the functions (activities,
                      actions, processes, operations) within the system or one of its parts.
                      The model aims at facilitating the identification of 
                      information needs and helping to recognize opportunities.
                      Amongst other funct. diagrams include:
                      - Data Flow Diagram
                      - Sequence  Diagram
  
OºComponent diagramº  Diagram which has the purpose of representing the 
                      internal structure of the software system modeled in terms of its main 
                      components and the relationships between them. 
                      A component is a software unit with a distinct 
                      identity, as well as a distinct responsibility and 
                      well-defined interfaces.
  
OºDeployment diagramº Diagram which describes a system in terms of hardware 
                      resources, nodes, and relationships between them.
                      Often there is a diagram showing how the software 
                      components are distributed in the available hardware resources on the system.
                      In essence, it shows the physical location (deployment) of components of the architecture
  
OºActivity diagramº   The process view is a way of showing what the system does at a high level 
                      from a process prospective, explaining how the small 
                      steps within the process fit together, in terms of 
                      order and information flow.
  
OºUse case diagramº   Diagram representing the actors outside of a system 
                      capable of interacting with the system itself. It represents the highest 
                      level view of a system.  
                      Shows the system as a whole and its input and output to and from external elements.

                    - GRAFCET: From frech "Graphe Fonctionnel de Commande des Étapes et Transitions" (Functional Graph 
                                           of transition and stage command) is a representation and analysis mode for
                                           an automata, particularly well adapted to systems of sequential evolution,
                                           (splitable into stages). It is derived from the mathematical model of 
                                           Petri Networks.
                                         @[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafcet]

                                           The technique de l'électricité (UTE) unified model is like:
                                           - stage is representeda as an square with a number inside.
                                             - An active stage can be drawn with a point down the number. 
                                             - Related actions are indicated literally or with a symbol, in a
                                               rectangle placed to the right.
                                             - An initial stage is drawn with a double square.
                                           - An oriented link is represented by a line, by default, drawn vertically
                                             up-to-down or left-to-right. In other case, arrows are used. 
                                             - Crossing lines are avoided.
                                           - A transition among two stages is represented with a perpendicular bar(stick)
                                             to oriented links that related previous and next stage.
                                             - A transition indicates the possibility of evolution of stages.
                                               For each transition a "réceptivité" is writen to the right of the bar. 
                                               The "réceptivité" is a logical condition allowing to distinguish among all
                                               combinations of available "next" stages.

@[https://www.google.com/search?q=keywords+categories+ontologies+database]
- Using software terminology keywords can be:
  - namespaces grouping related content.
  - Constructors or factories of many other words 
  - module name for words in such "module".

- From @[https://biznology.com/2018/02/what-is-a-keyword-ontology/]
  - A keyword ontology is a knowledge graph describing relationships 
    between the keywords your target audiences frequently use in search 
    queries and the products and services you sell.
    - It can include other relationships as well, such as taxonomies,
      information architectures, social listening queries, competitors, etc.
  
  - Not that your audience always comes to the content that sells your 
    products through search. But a large of enough sample of them do that 
    the keywords they use tell you a lot about the information they need 
    to ultimately buy your products. A keyword ontology helps you 
    understand which words tend to go with which products, and how you 
    can out think your competition to deliver the content your prospects 
    need.
  
  - bold claim:
    "Keywords are the life’s blood of your marketing enterprise."
    it is not just about choosing the right search words for your 
    paid search campaigns. They can serve as a foundation for external
    organic search, internal search, navigation, and social listening.
  
    Q: If keyword research is so important, why do so few companies do it well?
    A: Because it’s really hard... Done well, keyword research is typically a
       manual process of checking each search result on the top page in Google
       for each keyword.

  Bº...primary benefits of a keyword ontology are scale, collaboration, and automation...º

Extraced from "A systematic literature review of blockchain-based
applications:Currentstatus,classification and open issues"
Fran Casinoa, ThomasK. Dasaklisb,Constantinos Patsakisa,

To provide a transparent, reproducible and scientific literature 
review of blockchain-based applications, the process suggested by 
Briner and Denyer (2012)as well as some features of the PRISMA 
statement (Moher et al., 2009) have been adopted. 
The overall methodological approach includes the following steps:
1. Identify the need for the review, prepare aproposal for the review, and develop the review protocol.
2. Identify the research, select the studies, assess the quality, take notes and extract data, synthesise the data.
3. Report the results of there view.
3.1. Locating studies 
  To address our primary research question, a systematic literature search 
  was carried out during January 2018 without time frame restrictions 
  and the results were subsequently updated during April 2018.
     Scopus was used as the main scientific database in which the term 
  “blockchain” was searched in all articles’titles. Additional 
  searches using the referenced works of relevant articles were also 
  conducted (snowball effect). Relevant “grey literature”, 
  including unpublished research commissioned by governments or 
  private/public institutions was also identified through electronic 
  searches. To identify the published grey literature, we evaluated the 
  first 200 hits from Google. Alternate terms for “blockchain” and 
  “application” were used during the search. The hand-search 
  reference list in several reports resulted in additional grey 
  literature, particularly research and committee reports or policy 
  briefs from both private and public sector 
  institutions/organizations. A flowchart of the strategy implemented 
  is presented inFig. 2. In addition, several refinement features of 
  Scopus were extensively used (multiple refinements of results  
  following the context of specific articles,related documents search, 
  etc.). When the abstract of a particular study was not available, the 
  full article was retrieved and assessed for relevance.All potentially 
  relevant articles were retrieved in fulltext.

3.2. Study selection and evaluation
      The eligibility of the retrieved literature was evaluated  
   independently by the authors based on a set of 
      predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria (seeTable 2). Some 
   exclusion criteria were used before introducing the literature in the 
   bibliographic manager(language, subject area and document type 
   restrictions). Initially, the abstracts of all research papers and 
   introductory sections of grey literature were assessed. Articles 
   meeting one of the exclusion criteria were excluded and sorted by 
   reason of exclusion. Afterwards,a full-text review also took place, 
   and some additional articles were excluded from the study documenting 
   the reasons for exclusion. Any discrepancy with respect to the 
   relevance of reviewed articles was resolved through discussion until 
   consensus was reached. Overall, several studies were excluded because 
   they were focused primarily on the technical aspects of blockchain 
   tech-nology and/or blockchain architecture. Articles not fitting the 
   inclusion criteria were set aside and consequently used in the 
   in-troduction of this article.
   

   3.3. Analysis and synthesis
   All articles and reports meeting the inclusion criteria were 
entered into a qualitative analysis software (MAXQDA11), and data 
were analysed in emerging themes. The reviewers independently carried 
out the thematic content analysis. Afterwards, the three clusters of 
coded segments were compared(rate of consensus was approximately 
75%), agreed upon for all articles and summarised in one set of 
themes and sub-themes

- Legacy system documentation
- Any other input data 

  And how you manage their possible modification.

4 Configuration management
    If you instantiate the software configuration management plan 
  document, you may add a reference to that doc and leave this section 
  and subsections blank.

  4.1 Software configuration management
  The management of the software configuration may be included in this 
  section: what kind of SCM tool is used, when branches are made etc...
  How is the scm database saved or archived, when and where
  How a version is extracted and delivered, for verification phases,

  It may be also described either in your quality management system 
  procedures or in a software configuration management plan.

  4.2 Documentation configuration management
    This section present the documentation management rules for all 
  documents sent or received during the XXX project.  It may be also 
  described in your quality management system procedures. In this case, 
  this section is not useful.

5 Software development management
  If you instantiate the "software development plan" document, you may 
  add a reference to that doc and leave this section and subsections 
  blank.

  5.1 Software development process
    The software development process chosen for the project is the 
  waterfall/SCRUM/Extreme programming model (choose yours).  The 
  waterfall/SCRUM/Extreme programming model was chosen for the reasons 
  below: add justification.

  5.2 Software development tools
  5.2.1 Tools
  Describe the IDE, the SCM tools, any tool used to write and manage 
  requirements, code and configuration. Dont forget their versions. 
  SCM tools are described more precisely in « configuration management »
  Examples
  - Eclipse + list of plugins or VS2010 + list of plugins
  - Purify, boundschecker,
  - Git, redmine, Hudson,
  - Clearcase,
  - Rational Rose, Together J,
  - Doors (erk !),

  - Or you stick to a version during the developpement and maintenance.
    Explain you choice.

  5.3 Software development rules and standards
    Describe here the standards and rules used for software 
  development, like modelling (UML), data modelling, coding rules,

  6 Tests phases management
    If you instantiate the software development plan document and 
  describe phases in that doc, you may add a reference to that doc and 
  leave this section and subsections blank.

  6.1 Integration tests (Optional)
    Describe how integration is managed Phases, reviews, documentation 
  Even if this may be described in your quality management system, I 
  recommend you to describe what is forecasted.

  6.2 Verification tests
    Describe how verification tests are managed. Phases, reviews, 
  documentation  Even if this may be described in your quality 
  management system, I recommend you to describe what is forecasted.

    Tests is often the weak link of soft development. Thinking about 
  tests at the beginning of the project is worth the effort.

  Example:
  Tests are split in four phases:
  * Alpha 1 tests: in this phase, V0.1 of software will be tested. 
    Testers will be the software development team. Each member tests a 
    portion of software developed by another member. Software will be 
    directly tested on the development platform
  * Alpha 2 tests: in this phase, V0.5 of software will be tested. 
    Tester will be the software integrator. Software will be installed on 
    the integration and test platform.
  * Beta 1 tests: in this phase, V0.8 of software will be tested. 
    Tester will be the software integrator and selected end-users. 
    Software will be installed on the integration and test platform.
  * Beta 2 tests: in this phase, V0.9 of software will be tested. 
    Testers will be selected end-users. Software will be installed on the 
    pilot platform in.
  Tests phases are described in the software tests plan OR below:
  6.2.1 Phase 1
  Describe the verification phase:
  - In: what is verified (version Vx.y.z)
  - Tasks: how it is verified (tests are done according to software test description doc XXX)
  - Out: the test report
  - Acceptation criteria: how the tests are passed or failed.
  
  Example of acceptation criteria, with bugs levels ratios (dummy but very effective):
  - Alpha tests: all blocking bugs are fixed
  - Beta tests:  all major bugs found in alpha tests are fixed and less than 20% of remaining bugs are major
  - Final version: all major bugs are fixed and 90% of minor bugs are fixed.
  
  Example of acceptation criteria, with rationale about requirements:
  - Alpha tests: tests about critical requirements (like those from 
    risk analysis) are passed and requirements about system-software 
    interfaces are passed
  - Beta tests:  tests on previous requirements and tests on 
    requirements about main use cases are passed
  - Final version: all tests are passed
  6.2.2 Phase 2
  Repeat the pattern for each phase
  Describe the verification phase:
  - In: what is verified (version Vx.y.z)
  - Task: how it is verified (tests are done according to software 
    test description doc XXX)
  - Out: the test report
  - Acceptation criteria: how the tests are passed or failed.

7 Problems resolution
  Describe here how bugs, requests, questions anything coming from 
  anyone outside the software development team. Especially for bugs, 
  how they are recorded, tracked, fixed.
  It may be also described in your quality management system 
  procedures. In this case, this section is not useful.

    Remark: there is no risk management section in this document. This 
  is voluntary, the risk management plan is an important document and 
  cannot be a section of project management.

1 Introduction
1.1 Document overview
    This document covers the risk management plan of XXX device, designed in XXX software development project.

It contains:
- The risk management organization and process during the software 
  development project,
- The risk management organization and process during maintenance, 
  after final delivery of the software development project.

Note: most of times, risk management organization is very different 
before and after design. You may split the risk management plan in 
two documents, the first one before end of design, the second one 
after the end of design.

  2 Risk management during software development
    This chapter covers the risk management process and organization 
    during the software development.

  2.1 Organization and Responsibilities
    Describe the organization of the team responsible for risk 
  management during design. You may add an organization chart or add a 
  reference to your project management plan, where the organization of 
  the project should be already described.
  
  Person          Responsibility 
  Project Manager * Overall management process responsibility
                  * Risk Management Plan development
                  * Creation and update of Risk Analysis Table
                  * Creation and update of Risk traceability matrix
                  * Creation and update Risk Analysis Report
  
  Quality Manager * Independent review of Risk Management File

  2.2 Qualification of personnel
    Describe the qualification of personnel responsible for the risk 
  management and risk analysis activities. Example:
  The personnel who participates to the risk analysis is composed of:
  - Experienced staff who was involved in the design process of similar products
  - The expert praticians who participate to the design process

  2.3 Objective of risk management activities
  The objective of risk management activities is to deliver a risk 
  analysis report, which contains:
  - The device characteristics that could impact on safety (ISO 14971),
  - The software safety classification (IEC 62304),
  - The risk analysis table,
  - The risk traceability matrix with design requirements,
  - The overall assessment of residual risk.

  The risk analysis table and risk traceability matrix will be created 
  and updated as necessary during software development, according to 
  tasks described in §2.4.

  Data on the risk analysis table includes:
  - List the columns, according to your risk analysis table in your risk analysis report,
  Data on the risk analysis table includes:
  - List the columns, according to your risk traceability matrix in 
  your risk analysis report,

  See the risk analysis report template for columns samples.
  Note: The Risk analysis may be performed with the help of the table 
  B.1 in IEC/TR 80002-1.

   The risk analysis report will summarize whether identified and 
  mitigated risks meet the acceptable values defined in this plan. It 
  will also include a statement indicating whether all known hazards 
  have been identified.
  
  The Risk Management File gathers this document and all documents quoted above.

   2.4 Tasks, Planning
  Describe how the risk management activities are planned during the project.
  The planning of risk activities shall be coherent with the planning 
  of the project found in §2.2 of the project management plan.
  Insert a table or list or diagram describing the planning.
  Important, list the deliverables and reviews of each phase of the project

  2.4.1 Task n
  Optional, add a sub-section for each task with:
  - Inputs of the task
  - Content of the task
  - Outputs of the task
  - Task reviews (in, if necessary, and out)
  - Relationship with development planning.
  Note: The tasks may group sets of activities found in §4 to §7 of ISO14971.
  Examples of tasks below:

  2.4.2 Risk analysis initialization
    During this phase, the following activities are performed: 
  identification of intended use, identification of characteristics 
  affecting the safety, assignation of safety class (see §2.5.1)

    creation of risk analysis
  - Relationship with development planning: Output data of this task 
    is input data for specification
  - End of Task review: review of risk analysis in draft version.

  2.4.3 Risk analysis update
    During this phase, the following activities are performed: 
  identification of mitigation actions, evaluation of hazards after 
  mitigation and analysis of risk/patient outcome ratio.
  - Inputs: publications, clinical data, any information prior to design phase
  - Two meetings with clinicians involved in the design process and system architect
  - Outputs: Update of risk analysis
  - Relationship with development planning: this task is performed during specifications
  - End of Task review: review of risk analysis in first revision.

  2.5 Criteria for Acceptability of Risk
    Warning: I recommend you to read carefully §3.4 of IEC 80002-1 to 
  understand how probability of occurrence is determined for software 
  failure.

  Risks will be evaluated in accordance with Risk Management Procedures for:
  - Probability of occurrence
  - Consequence of hazard
  - Any other criteria of your choice, like probability of detection 
    Based on the risk priority number, for each hazard analyzed for 
  XXXX , the Residual Risk will be considered Acceptable if the risk 
  priority number value is less than <fix your number>.

    Based on the risk priority numbers, the Overall Residual Risk for a 
  device will be considered acceptable if the following conditions are 
  satisfied:
  1. None of the identified hazards leads to an unacceptable risk 
     (i.e., no risk priority number above <your number minus 1> is 
     identified); and
  2. Another quantitative criterion of your choice
  3. Another one 
      Any risk priority numbers above these values need to have actions 
    taken to reduce the risk.

  2.6 Verification and Risk traceability matrix
   Verification testing activities will be cross-referenced in the 
  risk traceability matrix, as applicable.

  2.7 Approvals
    The Risk Management Plan must be reviewed and approved by XXXX prior 
  to the start of the risk assessment process.
    The Risk Analysis Report will be reviewed and approved by XXXX to 
  ensure completeness and conformance to this Risk Management Plan.

  2.8 Location of Risk Management File
   The Risk Management File is located in XXX (for example a document 
  management tool defined in the software development plan or project 
  management plan). This file contains all the documents related to the 
  management of risk for the device and is kept for the life of the 
  product.

  Ranking   Definition              Frequency (F)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  5         Every month             Frequent (very high probability)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  4         Once every year         Probable (high probability)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  3         Once in last 5 years    Occasional (moderate probability)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  2         Once in last 10 years   Unlikely (low probability)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1         Zero occurrence in the  Very Unlikely (very low probability)
            past 10 years with      
            similar products        
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  4.2 Consequences of Hazard
  Use criteria based on damages on patient and/or user
  Ranking   Definition    Clinical and Process End Effects
  5         Catastrophic  Serious injury (irreversible) or death of the patient or user
  4         Critical      Serious injury (reversible) to the patient or user.
                          New treatment required.
  3         Moderate      Moderate injury to the patient or user. Longer treatment
                          time or new minor treatment required.
  2         Minor         Minor injury to the patient. Longer treatment time
  1         Negligible/   No injury to the patient or user.
              Cosmetic

  4.3 Add your other criteria
  Your definition


  4.4 Determination of risk priority number
      A rule of your choice, like.
      Risk priority number =   criterion 1
                             x criterion 2
                             ...
                             x criterion n


       Example of cross-table of RPN with two criteria:

       CROSS TABLE OF RISK PRIORITY NUMBER

Frequent     5          10         15        20         25

             1            2        3          4          5


  4.5 Criteria for acceptability
  Acceptability per risk priority number is: (choose your own)
  * If the risk priority number is 1 to xx the risk is acceptable - 
    No recommended actions are required. 
  * If the risk priority number is xx to yy the risk is tolerable - 
    Some actions may be used, where possible, to lower the level. 
  * If risk priority number is above yy the risk is unacceptable. 
    Mitigation action must be implemented to lower the level.

3 VERIFICATION METHODS
  Discard this section if you don't want to have verification 
  methods attached to your requirements.

The verification methods of the requirements are defined below:
• Inspection (I): control or visual verification
  o Control of the physical implementation or the installation of 
    a component. The control verifies that the implementation or the 
    installation of a component is compliant with the requirements of 
    diagrams.
  o Control of the documentation describing a component. The control verifies that 
    the documentation is compliant with the requirements.
• Analysis (A): verification based upon analytical evidences
  o Verification of a functionality, performance or technical solution of a component 
    by analyzing the data collected by tests in real conditions, by simulation of real 
    conditions or by a analysis report.
  o Analysis of test data or of design data is used as appropriate to verify 
    requirements.
  o The verification is based upon analytical evidences obtained by calculations, like 
    modeling, simulation and forecasting.
  o Analysis is used when an acceptable level of confidence cannot be established by 
    other methods or if analysis is the most cost-effective solution.
• Demonstration (D): verification of operational characteristics, without quantitative 
  measurement
  o Verifying a requirement by demonstration implies that the 
    required functionality specified by a requirement is complete.
  o Demonstration is used when quantitative measurement is not required for 
    verification of the requirements
  o Demonstration includes the control of the technical solutions specified by the 
    non-functional requirements.
• Test (T): verification of quantitative characteristics with quantitative measurement
  o Verifying a functionality, performance or technical solution of a component by 
    executing testing scenarios in predefined, controlled and traceable testing 
    conditions.
  o Tests require the use of special equipment, instrumentation, simulation 
    techniques, or the application of established principles and procedures,
  o Data produced during tests is used to evaluate quantitative results and compare 
    them with requirements.

For each requirement of the SRS, a verification method is defined. 
Method is abbreviated I, A, D or T.

Requirement ID  Requirement Title                          Method
REQ-001         Verify that the speed is displayed in rpm  D
REQ-001         Verify background color  is blue           I

Note: do not mistake the two meanings of the word "test" in this document:
• The method of verification, named Test and abbreviated (T), as defined above.
• A test, or test case, is a sequence of actions to verify a 
  requirement. Tests are defined in the software test plan.

Examples of tests methods:
Inspection:
• Verify that the color of background is blue,
• Verify that the user manual has the CE mark on its cover
• Verify that the PC has 4Gb memory
• Verify that firmware version on electronic card is 1.0.1

Demonstration
• Verify that when the user closes the window, a confirmation message appears
• Verify that the file is saved in the output directory
• Verify that the result is shown
• Verify that if a value is out of range, a warning is displayed

Analysis:
• Verify that the statistical distribution of results of xxx 
  algorithm is a Gaussian with mean=x and stdev=y, when input
  data are blah blah
• Verify that the linear regression of results of xxx algorithm 
  is a line which value is 1 on the y-axis, at zero on the x-axis, 

Test:
• Verify that a file of 1Gb is processed in less than 3s
• Verify that the response time of the server is 15ms with 20 simultaneous requests

Rule of thumb for software, 80% of requirements are verified by 
demonstration, 15% by inspection and 5% by analysis or test methods.

4 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY
  Add a table with traceability of software requirements of this 
  document with user or system requirements.

  Example
SRS Req.    Req Title          Functional Req.  Req. Title
SRS-REQ-001 Reading ECG values FUN-REQ-00A      ECG post treatment
SRS-REQ-002 Writing results    FUN-REQ-00A      ECG post treatment

5 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
If necessary, add a list of critical requirements, or a list of reference to requirements in previous sections.
This list may be the result of risk analysis (ISO 14971).

Examples
Requirement ID  Requirement Title                Origin
REQ-001         Alarm when value out of range    Risk Analysis
REQ-002         Do not open file if no patient   Risk Analysis

1.4	Conventions
Add here conventions
For example for diagrams.

COTS, OTSS and SOUP refer to the same concept, i.e. software delivered by 3rd party that wasn't 
developed with a regulatory and/or normative compliant development process.
We deliberately use the term "SOUP", to focus on IEC 62304 compliance.

2	Architecture 
2.1	Architecture overview
Give a general description of the system, from the point of view of the user:
• In what environment it works (home, near patient bed, operating room ...)
• Who the users are
• What it is for,
• The main functions,
• The main interfaces, inputs and outputs.

If your software is integrated in a larger system, you may reference a document that describes 
this system.

2.2	Physical architecture overview
    Describe the hardware components on which software runs and their interactions/relationships
    Use components diagrams, deployment diagrams, network diagrams, interface diagrams...
2.2.1	Hardware Component 1 description
Describe the content of each hardware component in the architecture
Optional, you may not do it if your software is not class C according to IEC 62304
The description shall contain:
• Its identification
• The purpose of the component
• The software component it receives
• Its technical characteristics: type of machine, CPU, RAM, disk and so on.
• Its network hardware interfaces

2.2.2 Hardware Component 2 description
      Repeat the pattern for each top-level component.
2.2.3 Hardware Component 3 description
      Repeat the pattern for each top-level component.

2.3	Logical architecture overview
    Describe the top level software components and their interactions/relationships.
    Use UML package diagrams and/or layer diagrams and/or interface diagrams.
    Describe also the operating systems on which the software runs.
2.3.1 Software Component 1 description
    Describe the content of each top-level software component in the architecture
    Optional, you may not do it for 2 rationales:
    1. Either your software is not class C according to IEC 62304
    2. Or you describe each top level component in a SDD.

The description should contain:
• Its identification
• The purpose of the component,
• Its interfaces with other components,
• Its network interfaces,
• The hardware resources it uses, for example: average RAM usage, peak RAM usage and 
  peak frequency and duration, disk space for permanent data, disk space for cache data, 
  average CPU usage, peak CPU usage and peak frequency and duration ...
2.3.2 Software Component 2 description
      Repeat the pattern for each top-level component.
2.3.3 Software Component 3 description
      Repeat the pattern for each top-level component.
2.4	Software SOUP
    If you use SOUP (Software Of Unknown Provenance), list them here.
For each SOUP, describe:
• Its identification and version
• Its purpose
• Where it comes from: manufacturer, vendor, university ...
• Wether it is maintained by a third party or not
• If this is an executable,
  o What are the hardware / sotfware resources it uses
  o Wether it is insulated in the architecture and why
• Its interfaces and data flows
• Which SOUP functions the software uses
• How the SOUP is integrated in the software
• What hardware/software resources it requires for proper use

Note: have a look at FDA Guidance " Off-The-Shelf Software Use in Medical Devices " to 
determine if you need specific or special documentation for your COTS.

If there is a list of known bugs on your COTS, you may add here this list with a review of their 
consequences in terms of software failure and patient safety. If there are concerns about known 
bugs, they should be treated by the risk analysis process.

3	Dynamic behavior of architecture
The architecture was designed to answer to functional requirements.
For each main function of the system, add a description of the sequences / data flow that occur.
Use sequence diagrams, collaboration diagrams

3.1	Workflow / Sequence 1
    Describe here the workflow / sequence of a main function 
    For example, the user queries data, what happens, from his terminal to the database.
3.2	Workflow / Sequence 2
    Repeat the patern for each main function of the system
4	Justification of architecture
4.1	System architecture capabilities
    Describe here the rationale of the hardware / software architecture in terms of capabilities:
• Performances (for example response time, user mobility, data storage, or any functional 
  performance which has an impact on architecture)
• User / patient safety (see §4.3 and §4.4)
• Protection against misuse (see 4.4)
• Maintenance (cold maintenance or hot maintenance),
• Adaptability, flexibility
• Scalability, availability
• Backup and restore
• Hardware and Software security : fault tolerance, redondancy, emergency stop, recovery 
  after crash ...
• Administration,
• Monitoring, audit
• Internationalization

4.2	Network architecture capabilities
  If the medical device uses/has a network, describe here the rationale of the hardware / network 
  architecture:
• Bandwidth
• Network failures
• Loss of data
• Inconsistent data
• Inconsistent timing of data
• Cyber security (see FDA Guidance on Cyber Security of networked medical devices)

4.3	Risk analysis outputs
    If the results of risk analysis have an impact on the architecture, describe here for each risk 
    analysis output what has been done to mitigate the risk in the architecture.
    Use diagrams if necessary, like architecture before risk mitigation and architecture after risk 
    mitigation, to explain the choices.

4.4	Human factors engineering outputs
    If (by any chance) the results of human factors analysis have an impact on the architecture, 
    describe here for each risk output what has been done to mitigate the risk in the architecture.

4.5	Regulation on personal data
    If HIPAA or EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) are applicable, describe here how the architecture 
    is compliant to these regulations. For GDPR, see articles 25 and 32.

4.6	SOUP integration
    If the software architecture has a particular structure dedicated to SOUP integration, it can be 
    described here. For example a wrapper of the SOUP, or an external process + a socket 
    communication, ...


5 Requirements traceability
  Add a table with traceability of components of this document with functional requirements.

Requirement   Component                 Comment
REQ-001       The device shall do foo   COMPO-001: foo maker
                                        COMP-001 does foo.
                                        COMP-002 also does 
                                        verification of foo result.

This may be a difficult job. A high level function is usually handled by many components. In this 
case, quote only the component(s) which has(have) the major role.

Rº*1 WARN, WARN,  WARN:º
  NOTE that the Risk column can weight more than the Estimation column
  in context with high uncertainty as we switch from industrialized
  (automated repetitive tasks) to development of new Software Solutions
  with non-scoped definition about Use-stories, technology stack,...
  Since software is easy to industrialize, many projects fall under the
  second alternative and so Risks must be taken as reference over
  estimations.

- Exploitation: The utilisation of results in further research activities 
  other than those covered by the action concerned, or in developing, 
  creating and marketing a product or process, or in creating and 
  providing a service, or in standardisation activities.*

  - But why does Dissemination/Explotation not always happen? 
    or barriers to effective D&E in projects
    o Perceiving dissemination and exploitation as "tick boxes", not 
      important for the "real work" of the project
    o Confusion between communication, dissemination, 
      exploitation. Focusing on implementing and validating technical 
      objectives instead of aligning work with the needs of users and 
      stakeholders.
    o Limited considerations of what can be valuable key results of 
      the project.
    o Lack of skills (or interest) to effectively consider the value 
      and possible benefits of the key results outside "typical" 
      community.
    o Lack of knowledge of dissemination and exploitation risks and 
      opportunities, alternative channels and routes, stakeholders, 
      competing solutions.
    o Lack of reflection and joint discussions within the consortia

@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Model_and_Notation]

- Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard published by the 
  Object Management Group.[1] It is a standard approach for describing 
  and modeling repeatable decisions within organizations to ensure that 
  decision models are interchangeable across organizations.

- The DMN standard provides the industry with a modeling notation for 
  decisions that will support decision management and business rules. 
  The notation is designed to be readable by business and IT users 
  alike. This enables various groups to effectively collaborate in 
  defining a decision model:

- the business people who manage and monitor the decisions
- the business analysts or functional analysts who document the 
  initial decision requirements and specify the detailed decision 
  models and decision logic,
- the technical developers responsible for the automation of systems 
  that make the decisions.

- The DMN standard can be effectively used standalone but it is also 
  complementary to the BPMN and CMMN standards. BPMN defines a special 
  kind of activity, the Business Rule Task, which "provides a mechanism 
  for the process to provide input to a business rule engine and to get 
  the output of calculations that the business rule engine might 
  provide"[2][3] that can be used to show where in a BPMN process a 
  decision defined using DMN should be used.

- DMN has been made a standard for Business Analysis according to BABOK v3.[4][5]

<span title>Sociocracy 7 principles:</span>

· open framework for evolving agile and resilient organizations.

https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/04/principles-sociocracy-30

Principles guide behaviour when made explicit can raise 
consciousness and help to evolve culture.                                   

Sociocracy 3.0 seven principles:
· Empiricism: do things based on evidence, experiment,
  test assumptions and be prepared to re-evaluate knowledge 
  based on new experience.
· Effectiveness: extends beyond just efficiency to consider the 
  bigger picture and the impact of actions, both now and in  
  the future.
· Transparency: assure things are out in the open, visible 
  and understandable to those who need to know or are affected. 
  Make information available and understandable for everyone
  unless there is a good reason for confidentiality.
· Continuous improvement: learn from work and mistakes
· Accountability: take care of ownership/responsibilities.
· Equivalence: people affected by decisions are involved in  
               making them and influence/change them.
· Consent: do things in the absence of reasons not to do them. 
    Aim for "good enough for now and safe enough to try" decisions
    improve as it becomes obvious how to do so
    (supremacy lies with the argument, not a person!).

• WDL makes it straightforward to defineºanalysis tasks, chain themº
 ºtogether in workflows, and parallelize their executionº.
• It strives to achieve portability not only across execution platforms,
  but also different types of users.
• Language targets analysts, programmers, operators,
