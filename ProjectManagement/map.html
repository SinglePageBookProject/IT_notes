  <span xsmall>MoSCoW Task Prioritization</span>
  MoSCoW method  is  one  of  the  most  used  prioritization  
techniques  in  the  project  management  and software development 
and for this reason it was selected in the current deliverable. 

  Its primary role is to define a common baseline with partners on how 
they evaluate (e.g. most important/important/least important/etc.) 
each defined requirement. 

The acronym, MoSCoW, stands for 4 categories of prioritizations:
• "Must  have" requirements are considered vital/critical for the partner in order 
  to obtain a successful  outcome.  As  a  result,  these  are  
  considered  non-negotiable  and  mandatory. Furthermore,  any 
  solution delivered withouta requirement tagged as a must is not 
  considered viable.  If a workaround can be found for a requirement, 
  then this is not considered as “Musthave”. 

• "Should have" requirements:
  This  type comprises   all requirements that are not considered vital 
  but are important for the partner. The solution is considered viable 
  even if the requirement is not met. A workaround can be employed and 
  the solution will remain viable.

• "Could have" :
  contains all the  desired  features  that  could improve  the  
  functionality/work  experience  of the  solution  but  do  not  
  affect  the  result.  These  requirements have a minimum impact on 
  the end goal and are usually firstlyremoved in case of limited 
  timeframes.  

• "Won’t have" : (this time)
  requirements that are not needed at the current time or which do not 
  bring any addition to the value of the desired solution. Such 
  requirements do not have priority at the current moment of time. 

BºAccording  to  literature,  this prioritization  method  is        º
Bºefficient  and  offers  better  results  when  compared  to simplerº
Bºprioritizations approaches like high/medium/low prioritization or  º
Bºsequential prioritization.                                         º

<span xsmall>Diagram Types</span>
Term                Meaning
Functional diagram  Structured representation of the functions (activities,
                    actions, processes, operations) within the system or one of its parts.
                    The model aims at facilitating the identification of 
                    information needs and helping to recognize opportunities.

Component diagram   Diagram which has the purpose of representing the 
                    internal structure of the software system modeled in terms of its main 
                    components and the relationships between them. 
                    A component is a software unit with a distinct 
                    identity, as well as a distinct responsibility and 
                    well-defined interfaces.

Deployment diagram  Diagram which describes a system in terms of hardware 
                    resources, nodes, and relationships between them.
                    Often there is a diagram showing how the software 
                    components are distributed in the available hardware resources on the system.
                    In essence, it shows the physical location (deployment) of components of the architecture

Activity diagram    The process view is a way of showing what the system does at a high level 
                    from a process prospective, explaining how the small 
                    steps within the process fit together, in terms of 
                    order and information flow.

Use case diagram    Diagram representing the actors outside of a system 
                    capable of interacting with the system itself. It represents the highest 
                    level view of a system.  
                    Shows the system as a whole and its input and output to and from external elements.

- Projects takes too much (1 year taking requirements, 10 months
  developping,...)

- Agile applies to project, people relationships,...
  prioritization of tasks, ...  better visibility,
  better prioritization, less downtime between tasks,
  Improved teamwork

- What's a task:
  A case study / promo-video / market-research /... ? NO. Too long.
  A task in agile is something that takes more than 30 minutes and less 
  than 3 days.

- How to estimate the time?
  Estimating is hard.
  Use story points (vs hours):
      1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48
      This could map (not necesarely) to:
      30min, 1hour, 2hours, 4hours, 1day, 2days, 3days.

SCRUM vs KANBAN: 
  Both are subsets of Agile.
  SCRUM targets dead-lines. (fixed dates)
   * Releases are more important that "what's in".
   * Delay release or drop feature?
   * Uses a PLAN MODE

  Kanban:
   * Service team. new tickets  always comming in.
   * Prioritazing the tickets (tasks) and doing in the right order
     is more important than how many are done in a week.
   * No Plan mode, no Sprints. 
     PLAN MODE:
   * Do NOT uses a PLAN MODE

JIRA WORKFLOW SUMMARIZED:
  - We have a team of developers than pass the work to the QA Team that
  pass the work back to the developers or forwards it to the client,...
  - There can be "millions" of different workflows.


JIRA ISSUES and DASHBOARDS:
   - Dashboards allows for example to follow  others people work.
