" CSCOPE settings for vim           
"
" This file contains some boilerplate settings for vim's cscope interface,
" plus some keyboard mappings that I've found useful.
"
" USAGE: 
" -- vim 6:     Stick this file in your ~/.vim/plugin directory (or in a
"               'plugin' directory in some other directory that is in your
"               'runtimepath'.
"
" -- vim 5:     Stick this file somewhere and 'source cscope.vim' it from
"               your ~/.vimrc file (or cut and paste it into your .vimrc).
"
" NOTE: 
" These key maps use multiple keystrokes (2 or 3 keys).  If you find that vim
" keeps timing you out before you can complete them, try changing your timeout
" settings, as explained below.
"
" Happy cscoping,

    " The following maps all invoke one of the following cscope search types:
    "
    "   's'   symbol: find all references to the token under cursor
    "   'g'   global: find global definition(s) of the token under cursor
    "   'c'   calls:  find all calls to the function name under cursor
    "   't'   text:   find all instances of the text under cursor
    "   'e'   egrep:  egrep search for the word under cursor
    "   'f'   file:   open the filename under cursor
    "   'i'   includes: find files that include the filename under cursor
    "   'd'   called: find functions that function under cursor calls
    "
    " Below are three sets of the maps: one set that just jumps to your
    " search result, one that splits the existing vim window horizontally and
    " diplays your search result in the new window, and one that does the same
    " thing, but does a vertical split instead (vim 6 only).
    "
    " I've used CTRL-\ and CTRL-@ as the starting keys for these maps, as it's
    " unlikely that you need their default mappings (CTRL-\'s default use is
    " as part of CTRL-\ CTRL-N typemap, which basically just does the same
    " thing as hitting 'escape': CTRL-@ doesn't seem to have any default use).
    " If you don't like using 'CTRL-@' or CTRL-\, , you can change some or all
    " of these maps to use other keys.  One likely candidate is 'CTRL-_'
    " (which also maps to CTRL-/, which is easier to type).  By default it is
    " used to switch between Hebrew and English keyboard mode.
    "
    " All of the maps involving the <cfile> macro use '^<cfile>$': this is so
    " that searches over '#include <time.h>" return only references to
    " 'time.h', and not 'sys/time.h', etc. (by default cscope will return all
    " files that contain 'time.h' as part of their name).


    " To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-\', followed by one of the
    " cscope search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d).  The result of your cscope
    " search will be displayed in the current window.  You can use CTRL-T to
    " go back to where you were before the search.

<span xsmall>ASTRÉE</span>
<span xsmall>Static</span>
<span xsmall>Analyzer</span>
David Monniaux (CNRS), member of the ASTRÉE project, says: “ASTRÉE is a 
static analyzer based on abstract interpretation that aims at proving the 
absence of runtime errors in safety-critical software written in a subset of 
the C programming language.”

“Automatically analyzing programs for exactly checking properties such as the 
absence of runtime errors is impossible in general, for mathematical reasons. 
Static analysis by abstract interpretation works around this impossibility 
and proves program properties by over-approximating the possible behaviors of 
the program: it is possible to design pessimistic approximations that, in 
practice, allow proving the desired property on a wide range of software
.”

“So far, ASTRÉE has proved the absence of runtime errors in the primary 
control software of the Airbus A340 family. This would be impossible by 
software testing, for testing only considers a limited subset of the test 
cases, while abstract interpretation considers a superset of all possible 
outcomes of the system.”

“ASTRÉE is written in OCaml and is about 44000 lines long (plus external 
libraries). We needed a language with good performance (speed and memory usage
) on reasonable equipment, easy support for advanced data structures, and 
type and memory safety. OCaml also allows for modular, clear and compact 
source code and makes it easy to work with recursive structures such as 
syntax trees.”

@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/02/zz-formal-verified-c-dialect/]

ZetZ, or ZZ for short, is a Rust-inspired C dialect that is able to formally 
verify your code by executing it symbolically at compile time in a virtual 
machine.

ZZ is targeted to software that runs close to hardware but it can be also used 
to build cross-platform, ANSI-C compliant libraries. Actually, ZZ works as a 
transpiler to C code, which is then fed into any standard C compiler. In 
contrast to how many modern languages approach safety, ZZ does not preclude or 
limit features that are deemed "unsafe", such as raw pointer access. Rather, it 
uses static single assignment form (SSA) to prove your code is undefined 
behaviour-free at compile time in a SMT prover such as yices2 or z3.

Earlier in the year the Undo team released Live Recorder 5, the latest version of their “software flight recorder technology” for C/C++, Rust, and Go applications that enables the capture of all nondeterministic data within an application’s execution for debugging purposes. The captured recording allows the recreation of an application’s entire memory and the register state, which supports the replay of execution steps, backwards and forwards, via the UndoDB debugger. At the recent QCon San Francisco conference, InfoQ sat down with Dr Greg Law, co-founder and CTO at Undo, in order to learn more.

Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
(used by NumPy for example: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/swig.interface-file.html)
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language, Java including Android, Lua, OCaml, Octave, Scilab and R. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML. SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects.

By David Malcolm March 26, 2020
Static analysis in GCC 10

I work at Red Hat on GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. For the next 
major release of GCC, GCC 10, I’ve been implementing a new 
-fanalyzer option: A static analysis pass to identify various 
problems at compile-time, rather than at runtime.

My thinking here is that it’s best to catch problems as early as 
possible as the code is written, using the compiler the code is 
written in as part of the compile-edit-debug cycle, rather than 
having static analysis as an extra tool “on the side” (perhaps 
proprietary). Hence, it seems worthwhile to have a static analyzer 
built into the compiler that can see exactly the same code as the 
compiler sees—because it is the compiler.

This issue is, of course, a huge problem to tackle. For this release, 
I’ve focused on the kinds of problems seen in C code—and, in 
particular double-free bugs—but with a view toward creating a 
framework that we can expand on in subsequent releases (when we can 
add more checks and support languages other than C).

My hope is that the analyzer provides a decent amount of extra 
checking while not being too expensive. I’ve aimed for -fanalyzer 
to “merely” double the compile time as a reasonable trade-off for 
the extra checks. I haven’t succeeded yet, as you’ll see below, 
but I’m working on it.
