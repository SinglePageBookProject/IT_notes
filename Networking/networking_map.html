OReilly Courses: Leveraging multiplatform DNS for web application resiliency,Sponsored by Oracle Dyn, Instructor Matt Torrisi
    What you'll learn Instructor Schedule
    
       The threat to an organization?s DNS has never been more pronounced, and 
the operations community is furiously working to protect against attacks and other
types of service disruptions. The most obvious way to increase DNS resiliency 
comes through having multiple providers. However, this isn?t as simple as adding
a secondary or alternate DNS service. As service disruptions become increasingly
prevalent, your management of multiple DNS instances must become more sophisticated.
 Understanding how multiple vendors and systems can work in unison rather than 
creating silos or reducing strategic capabilities?is pivotal to effective asset management.
    
Join Matt Torrisi to learn how to implement multiplatform DNS. Along the way, Matt covers 
the important criteria in assessing DNS network compatibility and demonstrates how
to use DNS as a traffic-steering platform. You'll also create an optimized traffic
flow diagram for your organization's domain so you can communicate the concepts you've
learned in this session with your own team.

By the end of this course, you'll understand:
  - How traffic is decided on multiplatform DNS delegations during normal operation and during failure states
  - Important criteria in assessing DNS network compatibility
  - How to use DNS as a traffic-steering platform for higher-level traffic
    
And you'll be able to:
  - Articulate the high-level narrative of multivendor DNS and why it is important for domain resilience
  - Identify areas of risk for domain resolution
  - Apply DNS traffic patterns to enable scalable multivendor DNS solutions with even the tallest zones and most complex traffic-steering solutions
  - Deploy DNS with confidence across multiple platforms
    
  You want to understand how to craft scalable traffic flows for your domains that utilize GSLB.
  You're responsible for an enterprise solution using a single DNS solution, and you want 
     to understand how to build redundancy into your delegation.
   
Prerequisites
  A working knowledge of authoritative DNS
    
Required materials and setup:
   An exported zone file to use for the hands-on exercise (Be sure you have some understanding
   of the critical hosts within it, especially if those hosts already have traffic steering
   functionality in the current environment.)
    
Lecture: The importance of DNS to both traditional and cloud-native organizations; 
. anatomy of a DNS query and response
    
Lecture: Secondary DNS isn't just a backup. The case for multiple DNS platforms;
    using zone file management to keep multiple vendors in sync; the pros and cons of 
    including internal NS in a public delegation; vendor evaluation criteria for inclusion 
    in a long-term multivendor DNS strategy
    
   
Lecture: Using DNS for traffic steering.  capabilities and caveats; using management zones
    to move traffic steering capabilities off a zone; a comparison of centralized management
    zones and cuts in authority; keeping response behavior equal across multiple providers
    with proprietary solutions; introduction to tool-based orchestration and common libraries
    
    Optimizing your zone file for multiplatform DNS (30 minutes)
    
   Hands-on exercise: Take one of your own zones and apply the management zone techniques to 
  develop a draft traffic steering flow in a multilayer, multiplatform environment

<a href="http://he.net/ip_transit.html">Hurricane Network IP-Transit</a>
   Hurricane Electric operates one of the top International Internet Backbones.
   
   Because Hurricane supports IPv6 and IPv4 over the same connection at no additional charge, 
   once you get an IP Transit connection from Hurricane Electric you will be already set to add
   IPv6 support for your customers.
   
   Service starting from $200 per month

    All core nodes have 100 Gbps or multiple 10 Gbps (OC-192) connections - Each of our core routers
    has a combination of backbone circuits, exchange ports, and private peering connections.
    International Network - Hurricane Electric has over 21,000 BGP sessions with over 7,200 
    different networks via over 185 major exchange points and thousands of customer and private peering ports.
    Resilient Long Haul Topology - Hurricane Electric has at least five redundant 100G paths 
    crossing the US, four separate 100G paths between the US and Europe, and 100G rings in Europe and Asia.
    Speeds up to 100 Gbps and greater - Hurricane Electric can deliver 100GE (100 Gigabit Ethernet
    ), 10GE (10 Gigabit Ethernet), and gige (Gigabit Ethernet) ports at all core router locations
    . For speeds in excess of 10 Gbps, Hurricane Electric can deliver 100GE or multiple 10GE ports.
    Over 100 Terabits of Edge Capacity - Hurricane Electric has over 100 Terabits of edge 
    capacity to allow us to easily help you with your growing network needs.
    Jumbo Frames - Hurricane Electric's entire network is Jumbo Frame (9000 byte MTU) capable to 
    allow higher data throughput. Jumbo frames allow you to more easily attain higher data speeds 
    for large data transfers between geographically separated locations when both locations have jumbo frame capability.
    IPv6 transit and IPv4 transit on the same customer connection - Because Hurricane Electric's 
    network is dual stack, Hurricane Electric can deliver wirespeed 10GE IPv6 transit on the same port as your IPv4 transit.
    Direct DWDM Backbone Circuits - All our backbone circuits are run over DWDM wavelengths 
    directly on fiber, not on some other carrier's MPLS.
    Fiber Internet Connections - Get IP Transit via fiber at 1310nm or 1550nm (singlemode) using 
    your SFP, SFP+, QSFP, QSFP28, or CFP2.
    Burstable or Flat Rate - Burstable pricing as well as flat rate pricing is available. We can accommodate your rapid growth or fixed budget.

    Key Features and Benefits
        Port Availability - at all locations globally.
        BGP - included at no extra charge.
        IPv6 and IPv4 on the same connection - included at no extra charge.
        Single AS worldwide - simpler global routing, provisioning, and service.
        Flexible Billing - Burstable or Flat Rate
        Rapid Turnaround Capability - if you can get a cross connect to a core node we can bring you live!
        Ability to grow with you.
    
    Availability
    Hurricane Electric IP Transit service is available in colocation facilities such as Equinix, 
    CoreSite, Cologix, Telehouse, Interxion, Itconic, Global Switch, etc. and cities such as New 
    York, Los Angeles, San Jose, Seattle, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, Ashburn, Toronto, London, 
    Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Stockholm, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.
