<span xsmall>Azure Sphere</span>

- How Azure Sphere ensures IoT security within a 4MB Linux stack(Sep 26, 2018)
@[http://linuxgizmos.com/how-azure-sphere-ensures-iot-security-within-a-4mb-linux-stack/]
 - Azure Sphere also includes a proprietary crypto/secure boot
   stack called the Microsoft Pluton Security Subsystem, which runs 
   on an MCU, as well an Azure Sphere Security Service, a turnkey
   cloud service for secure device-to-device and device-to-cloud communication.

 - The Azure Sphere MT3620 Development Kit features MediaTek’s MT3620,
    a 500MHz Cortex-A7/Cortex-M4F hybrid SoC that runs the lightweight Azure
    Sphere OS on a single -A7 core.

- Custom Linux Security Module, which coordinates with Cortex-M4's 
  proprietary Pluton security code using a mailbox-based protocol.

- Azure Sphere OS sits on top of the MCU’s Pluton stack, a 
  security stack based on Arm TrustZone. This is followed by the custom 
  Linux kernel, which in turn is topped by a cloud services update
  connectivity layer. 
- The top level is for POSIX and real-time I/O app containers.

- custom kernel based on mainline Linux 4.9. 

MAJOR SHRINKAGE:
- "avoid putting text into memory": lot on Execute-In-Place (XiP),
   """XiP lets you take a flash region and map it into the
      address space in read only, but also in a mode where 
      you can execute it as code."""

- """we tuned the kernel to make things modular so we could 
     turn things off""" ... cache sizes and patched to tweak default sizes

- turned off lot of the memory tracking options and things like kallsyms.
- cut sysfs, which saved almost 1MB.
- In the end, much of the kernel space was taken up by the
  network stack and hardware drivers.

SECURITY:
- Stripped-down version of the Linux Security Model (LSM)
  ""There's no shell or user account management,
     which really isn’t relevant for an IoT device and 
     there's no sophisticated job and process management."""

- Fairfax also added fields that created an app identity
  for every task. "Applications and kernel modules can
  use these new fields for extended access control" 
  - "Values are immutable — once set, they inherit by default."


- Linux treats the entire GPIO infrastructure as a single resource
  said Fairfax. "In the real world not everything connected to your 
  chip has the same sensitivity. I might have one GPIO pin that
  toggles an LED saying I'm connected to the network, which is
  not super sensitive, but another GPIO might open the solenoid 
  on my furnace to start gas flow, which is more worrisome."
  To compensate, the team added access control to existing 
  features like GPIO to provide more granular access control.

- Each application has metadata in the file system that says:
  "Here's how to run me and here’s what I need".
  By default, all you get is compute and RAM — even network
  access must be declared as part of the manifest. 

File System:
- ...They tried the read-only cramfs with XIP patches,
  as well as writable file systems like ext2, jfffs, and yaffs,
  but "they all took hundreds of kilobytes to initialize, or
  about 1/16th of the total system memory available.":j
  In the end, they ported the ultra-lightweight littlefs
  from Arm’s Mbed OS to Linux as a VFS module.

USER AND APPLICATION MODEL:
- custom init that calls the application manager that
  loads apps, configures their security environments, 
  and launches them. 
  """It's the only traditional process that runs on 
    our system — everything else is part of an application."""

- Azure Sphere applications are self describing and independently
  updatable. In fact, "they're actually their own independent file systems,"
  "They run isolated from each other and cannot access any resource from another app."

- There are initially four pre-loaded system applications:
  - network management
  - updates
  - command and control via USB
  - hardware crypto and RNG acceleration
- GDBServer is optional
- OEMs can "add one or two apps that contain their own business logic"

UPDATE POLICY:
- "everything is OTA updatable and everything is renewable"
- aiming for OTA security patch updates within 24 hours of public disclosure
- Microsoft will manage all the OS updates, OEMs control their own app updates.

- Future plans call for revisiting namespaces to create
  "something like a container" and there’s a plan to
  "reduce cap_sys_admin or make it more granular"

- Also planned to explore integrating parts of
  SELinux or AppArmor.

Introduction

Developing an embedded product requires 3 main steps:  selection of the 
proper hardware platform, operating system selection/setup, and User 
Interface (UI) development.  All 3 of these steps are very closely tied 
together.  t is critical to select the proper hardware platform that also has 
excellent operating system support as well as the proper UI tools.  Boundary 
Devices products are exclusively based on the very popular and powerful i.MX 
family of processors from Freescale.  Our boards have been designed to 
harness the extreme versatility of the processor while providing the user a 
variety of integration options.  On the operating system side, Boundary 
Devices has industry leading operating system options including Android, Yocto
, Ubuntu, and Buildroot.  The third and final piece of the puzzle is the UI 
and this blog post intends to show how fast and easy the setup to get started 
with a new Qt project when using Boundary Devices platforms.   One of the 
most complex and time-consuming elements of an embedded project is the User 
Interface development.  

Thanks to a Qt for Device Creation image (formerly called Boot2Qt or B2Qt) 
working on all our platforms, one can download the IDE and start developing 
within minutes!

Turn an old smartphone into a home automation gizmo

At the recent Embedded Linux Conference and OpenIoT Summit, Mozilla Technical 
Evangelist Dietrich Ayala proposed a simple and affordable solution to home 
automation: A discarded smartphone can handle some of the most useful home 
automation tasks without requiring expensive hubs and sensors 

“Many phones have proximity or ambient light sensors, orientation, and battery
,” continued Ayala.

Ayala introduced his “Context” JavaScript program for turning an old Firefox 
OS smartphone into a combination hub and sensor array for remote home monitoring.

Most commercial IoT products include cloud services for remote connectivity, 
storage, and in some cases, processing. “How much of your personal life is 
being exposed to a black box where you have no guarantee or visibility?” said 
Ayala. “There are no standards, legislation, or case law around what people 
can do with this data.”

Many hacker-oriented automation products avoid using the cloud, but at the 
price of greater complexity. You get more privacy and open source 
personalization, “but at a high cost in experimentation in time and learning
,” said Ayala.

IoT’s killer app: presence or absence

A greater challenge affecting commercial and DIY IoT systems alike is the 
lack of a compelling purpose. “You have to ask yourself, what problems am I 
addressing?” said Ayala. “Do I really need to have the light reflect my mood 
or do automated shopping? To me these aren’t solving day to day problems. 
People have problems like not having enough money or time, or worrying about 
sick relatives. Maybe they need to know if someone is in their house or 
whether basic services are working. What you need is physical awareness put 
in context — the presence or absence of things like noise, motion, or services.”

Most of these capabilities, Ayala realized, are already available on a 
smartphone even without hooking up additional sensors. You could even 
repurpose several old phones in a WiFi- or Bluetooth-based sensor 
network.

Ayala started by writing some JavaScript code to gain access to low level 
sensors. With Firefox OS, he found he could even avoid building a 
downloadable app. “With progressive web apps, you can distribute a web page, 
so users can load it and then receive push notifications forever without 
loading the page again,” said Ayala. “You don’t even need a UI. You can just 
reply to the body of channels and configure how much you want to know about a 
given topic.”

Notifications are currently sent to IFTTT’s maker channel. “From there, I can 
hook it up to wherever I want,” said Ayala.

Much of the functionality of Ayala’s Firefox OS script can work on other 
platforms. It would be fairly straightforward to do something similar in a 
mobile framework, or for more experienced developers, even a native app, 
Ayala said.

Ayala spent a lot of time studying the readouts from sensors, as well as from 
the phone’s microphone, camera, and, radios, that would enable a remote user 
to draw conclusions about what was happening at home. This contextual 
information could then be codified into more useful notifications.

With ambient light, for example, if it suddenly goes dark in the daytime, 
maybe someone is standing over a device, explained Ayala. Feedback from the 
accelerometer can be analyzed to determine the difference between footsteps, 
an earthquake, or someone picking up the device. Scripts can use radio APIs 
to determine if a person moving around is carrying a phone with a potentially 
revealing Bluetooth signature.

With the battery API, you can usually tell if the power went out. If the 
phone has some battery life and an SMS plan, you can have it send a text 
message alert.

When sensors hit certain levels, you can have the script use a media API to 
turn on a camera or mic to see what’s up. In one experiment, Ayala used the 
getUserMedia API to turn on the mic and record the average volume of ambient 
sound. “There are some signatures you can get from sound that might yield 
useful information around presence or absence,” he said.

Future enhancements might tap a mobile platform’s connectivity and discovery 
interfaces to hook up with other devices. On Firefox OS, these include TCP 
and UDP sockets, DLNA, and others. Ayala also sees possibilities using local 
speech recognition APIs.

“In the end, it’s about using the phone as an awareness tool,” said Ayala. “
About learning about the environment and yourself.”

<span xsmall>Narrow-band</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband]
In radio, narrowband describes a channel in which the bandwidth of the 
message does not significantly exceed the channel's coherence bandwidth.

In the study of wired channels, narrowband implies that the channel under 
consideration is sufficiently narrow that its frequency response can be 
considered flat. The message bandwidth will therefore be less than the 
coherence bandwidth of the channel. That is, no channel has perfectly flat 
fading, but the analysis of many aspects of wireless systems is greatly 
simplified if flat fading can be assumed.

Narrowband can also be used with the audio spectrum to describe sounds which 
occupy a narrow range of frequencies.

In telephony, narrowband is usually considered to cover frequencies 300–3400 Hz.

<span xsmall>Z-Wave</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave]
- Z-Wave is a wireless communications protocol used primarily for home 
  automation. It is a mesh network using low-energy radio waves to communicate 
  from appliance to appliance, allowing for wireless control of residential 
  appliances and other devices, such as lighting control, security systems, 
  thermostats, windows, locks, swimming pools and garage door openers. 
  Like other protocols and systems aimed at the home and office automation 
  market, a Z-Wave automation system can be controlled from a wireless keyfob, 
  a wall-mounted keypad or through smartphones, tablets or computers, with a Z-
  Wave gateway or central control device serving as both the hub controller and 
  portal to the outside. It provides interoperability between home 
  control systems of different manufacturers that are a part of its alliance. 
  There are a growing number of interoperable Z-Wave products; over 1,700 in 
  2017, and over 2,400 by 2018.

<span xsmall>LPWAN</span>
@[https://www.qwant.com/?q=LPWA++wikipedia]
A low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) or low-power wide-area (LPWA) network or low-power network (LPN) 
is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long range communications
at a low bit rate among things (connected objects), such as sensors operated on a battery.[1][2] 
The low power, low bit rate and intended use distinguish this type of network from a wireless WAN
that is designed to connect users or businesses, and carry more data, using more power. The LPWAN
data rate ranges from 0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s per channel.[3]

A LPWAN may be used to create a private wireless sensor network, but may also be a service or
infrastructure offered by a third party, allowing the owners of sensors to deploy them in
the field without investing in gateway technology.

<span xsmall>Multicast DNS</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS]
- In computer networking, the multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol resolves host 
names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name 
server. It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same 
programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast 
Domain Name System (DNS). Although Stuart Cheshire designed mDNS as a stand-
alone protocol, it can work in concert with standard DNS servers.

The mDNS protocol is published as RFC 6762, uses IP multicast User Datagram 
Protocol (UDP) packets, and is implemented by the Apple Bonjour and open 
source Avahi software packages. Android contains an mDNS implementation.
mDNS has also been implemented in Windows 10, but its use there is limited to 
discovering networked printers.

mDNS can work in conjunction with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a companion 
zero-configuration technique specified separately in RFC 6763.

@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa]
LoRa (Long Range) is a patented[1] digital wireless data communication 
technology developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France, and acquired by Semtech 
in 2012.[2] LoRa is a long-range wireless communication protocol that competes 
against other low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) wireless such as narrowband 
IoT (NB IoT) or LTE Cat M1. Compared to those, LoRa achieves its extremely 
long range connectivity, possible 100km+, by trading off data rate. Because 
its data rates are below 50kbps and because LoRa is limited by duty cycle and 
other restrictions, it is suitable in practice for non-real time applications 
in which one can tolerate delays.[3]

- 20$ easy-way to add touch-scr to IoT
"""All the components in Moddable Zero have been selected to keep the cost low
. The two main components are the NodeMCU board and the touch screen. The 
NodeMCU module carries the ESP8266, Wi-Fi antenna, Flash ROM, FTDI chip, and 
USB connector. The touch screen is an unbranded QVGA (240 x 320) display with 
16-bit pixels driven by an ILI9341 display controller and an XPT2046 
resistive touch controller. We’d like to use a capacitive touch display, but 
the prices are still considerably higher. That said, our touch driver 
delivers reliable touch input with the XPT2046."""

The Moddable SDK has four key features that make it realistic to build modern 
user experiences on Moddable Zero.

    Tools. Getting images that look good onto an inexpensive microcontroller 
is challenging. The Moddable SDK contains tools that convert PNG, JPEG, BMP, 
and animated GIFs into formats that can be rendered efficiently and stored 
compact on the microcontroller. There are also tools to compress anti-aliased 
fonts for use on the device.

    Graphics library. The Commodetto graphics library is used for all image 
loading and rendering in the Moddable SDK. It contains the Poco rendering 
engine which provides high speed rendering, with alpha channel support, 
blending, and clipping.

    UI framework. The Piu user interface framework is a true object oriented 
user interface library that tightly integrates with Poco to provide cascading 
styles, timeline animations, text layout, localization, touch handling, and 
more.

    JavaScript. Most developers find implementing a user interface in 
JavaScript to be faster and easier than using C or C++ as is common today on 
microcontrollers. Both Piu and Commodetto are designed to work efficiently 
with the XS JavaScript engine at the core of the Moddable SDK.

Apache PLC4X™: Universal Protocol Adapter for Industrial IoT

"""While with OPC-UA every device has to be retrofitted with the ability to speak a new protocol and use a common client to speak with these devices, PLC4X tries to provide a unified API by implementing drivers for communicating with most industrial controllers in the protocols they natively understand."""

Each of these drivers is being implemented from the specs or by reverse engineering protocols in order to be fully Apache 2.0 licensed.

Theºmajor benefitsºof PLC4X™ over OPC-UA, from our point of view are:
  - No need to modify existing hardware
  - Activating OPC-UA support on existing PLCs greatly increases the load on the PLCs
  - No need to pay for licenses to activate OPC-UA support

At first we will be concentrating on providing adapters for the most widely used protocol such as:
    BACnet
    Beckhoff ADS (TCP)
    Emerson DeltaV (UDP)
    EtherNet/IP (TCP)
    KNXNet/IP (UDP)

    OPC-UA (TCP)
    Profinet             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROFINET
                       - Profinet (usually styled as PROFINET, as a portmanteau for Process Field Net) 
                         is an industry technical standard for data communication over Industrial 
                         Ethernet, designed for collecting data from, and controlling equipment in 
                         industrial systems, with a particular strength in delivering data under tight 
                         time constraints (on the order of 1ms or less).[1] The standard is maintained 
                         and supported by Profibus & Profinet International, an umbrella organization 
                         headquartered in Karlsruhe, Germany. 
    S7-STEP7 (TCP)
    S7-TIA (TCP)

We are planning on providing support for the following programming languages:
    C++
    Java
    Python
______________________________
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller
PLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, ruggedized and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired relays, timers and sequencers. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments. A PLC is an example of a "hard" real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result. 

Los primeros PLC fueron diseñados para reemplazar los sistemas de relés lógicos.

IoT Visual Programming Environment Node-RED Hits 1.0

At the end of a two-year development cycle, Node-RED has finally reached 
version 1.0 bringing plenty of changes. Among the major new features in Node-
RED 1.0 are a new asynchronous message passing model, new completion API, and 
message cloning by default. Additionally, the visual editor got a 
revamp.

Created at IBM to make building industrial IoT solutions easier, Node-RED 
is an open-source visual programming environment enabling the creation of 
complex systems by interconnecting nodes representing physical devices, 
cloud systems, databases, API and so on. Nodes receive a message from any 
of their input nodes, process it, and propagate it through to output nodes
. The overall resulting flow is what constitutes the computation carried 
through by the system. Node-RED comes with a large collection of nodes to 
handle a variety of common tasks, including sending and receiving HTTP/UDP
/TCP/MQTT messages, running commands, and processing files, as well as 
nodes that simplifies the construction of complex logic, such as debug 
nodes, message multiplexers and demultiplexers, message buffers, and so on.
More nodes are available from the Node-RED library.

Until we look to emulate the open models of Wi-Fi and PCs, IoT will always be a source of never-ending e-waste.
The problem is not as simple as IoTs and the companies supporting them going belly-up. It's more along the lines of the vendors themselves being willfully negligent in providing a path to community support for these devices and penalizing their early adopters.

The data monitor allows to quickly identify if the device is sending data correctly. Until now, the user had to check the status of each device entering the cloud to check the operation of the data flow. In this way, it is possible to see data flowing from the device to the cloud, which shortens the time it takes to detect connection problems.

Domotic Home IP standard (Amazon, Apple, Google, Zigbee Alliance)
Amazon, Apple, Google, and the Zigbee Alliance joined together to promote the formation of the Working Group. Zigbee Alliance board member companies IKEA, Legrand, NXP Semiconductors, Resideo, Samsung SmartThings, Schneider Electric, Signify (formerly Philips Lighting), Silicon Labs, Somfy, and Wulian are also on board to join the Working Group and contribute to the project.

The goal of the Connected Home over IP project is to simplify development for manufacturers and increase compatibility for consumers. The project is built around a shared belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), the project aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.

The industry Working Group will take an open-source approach for the development and implementation of a new, unified connectivity protocol. The project intends to use contributions from market-tested smart home technologies from Amazon, Apple, Google, Zigbee Alliance, and others. The decision to leverage these technologies is expected to accelerate the development of the protocol, and deliver benefits to manufacturers and consumers faster. 

The project aims to make it easier for device manufacturers to build devices that are compatible with smart home and voice services such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and others. The planned protocol will complement existing technologies, and Working Group members encourage device manufacturers to continue innovating using technologies available today.A

Among the best of the open hardware and software vendors is Seeed, the self-proclaimed "IoT Hardware Enabler." I recently started seeing the Seeed logo on projects, so I contacted the company to learn about the interesting things they're doing. In response, they generously sent me one of their latest products: the Seeeduino Nano, a compact board that the company says is fully compatible with the Arduino Nano but at half the price and a quarter the size, along with a sample sensor to get me started.

A security researcher has identified a local-access technique that enables a complete bypass of all security within the popular ESP32 IoT chip, where malware can be implanted and never removed. 
The ESP32 chipset is significant to the industry, as it offers a dual core chip with WiFi and bluetooth to underly many devices. In January 2018, the manufacturer Espressif announced its milestone of having shipped over 100 million devices. ESP32 is a key component of many devices, including LiFX lightbulbs, and is also featured as a compatible device with AWS FreeRTOS within AWS IoT as well as Microsoft Azure IoT.

http://esp32.net/:
Ultra low power co-processor: allows you to do ADC conversions, computation, 
and level thresholds while in deep sleep. 
Created by Espressif Systems, ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power system on a chip 
(SoC) series with Wi-Fi & dual-mode Bluetooth capabilities! The ESP32 family 
includes the chips ESP32-D0WDQ6 (and ESP32-D0WD), ESP32-D2WD, ESP32-S0WD, and 
the system in package (SiP) ESP32-PICO-D4. At its heart, there's a dual-core 
or single-core Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor with a clock rate of up to 
240 MHz. ESP32 is highly integrated with built-in antenna switches, RF balun, 
power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management 
modules. Engineered for mobile devices, wearable electronics, and IoT 
applications, ESP32 achieves ultra-low power consumption through power saving 
features including fine resolution clock gating, multiple power modes, and 
dynamic power scaling.

136 SBCs undr 200 dolars:
http://linuxgizmos.com/ringing-in-the-new-year-with-136-open-spec-linux-sbcs-under-200/
  The most notable new SBC of the year was the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which 
  has a few glitches, primarily with heat buildup, but offers many welcome 
  improvements The RPi 4 adds a new 4GB RAM option and advances to a 1.5GHz, 
  quad -A72 Broadcom SoC, native GbE, and USB 3.0, and dual simultaneous displays.
  
  Other major new products include the Rockchip RK3399 based Orange Pi 4, NanoPi
  -M4V2, and Radxa Rock Pi 4, as well as boards based on the AI-enhanced 
  RK3399Pro, such as Radxa’s Rock Pi N10 and Vamrs’ VMARC RK3399Pro SoM Ficus2. 
  The Khadas Vim3 showcases an even higher-end Amlogic AM311D with its own 
  neural chip, and we saw the first major new BeagleBone design in a half 
  decade with the NPU and DSP-enhanced BeagleBone AI.
  
  
  There were fewer new boards in the under $35 category where FriendlyElec’s
 º$10 ZeroPiºwas a standout. Nevertheless, prices have dropped more than they’ve 
  increased, and there have been more than the usual number of pricing changes.

 Leading IT vendors have begun to offer IoT management systems to address security  gaps. For example, it is not uncommon for a single organization to have tens of thousands of IoT devices, in contrast to the mere dozens or hundreds of traditional servers and user devices. Mismatching standards across devices is a common ailment with such volume. 
Security frequently remains an afterthought to the already-taxing implementation of simple management capabilities at scale, evident with large-scale IoT hacking emerging as a vogue topic at top IT security conferences.

The Nyan Cat you see above is only 600 micrometers from head to tail. 
To put that into perspective, that’s about 10 times the diameter of 
a human hair. Also, that Nyan is etched into 200 nanometer thick 
copper foil and is the work of the HomeCMOS team, who is developing a 
hobbyist-friendly process to make integrated circuits and MEMS 
devices at home.

The project is far from complete; HomeCMOS has yet to produce a 
working IC but a few experiments – getting wet etching down pat and 
even building an almost working quantum qbit – are remarkable given 
the small amount of equipment and tools involved.

The HomeCMOS team has yet to actually make an integrated circuit or 
MEMS device, [Jeri Ellsworth] has shown this is possible by making 
transistors and integrated circuits at home. While there won’t be 
chips with millions of transistors coming out of the HomeCMOS lab 
anytime soon, it’s more than possible to see a few small-scale 
integration-level tech such as a few logic gates or a regulator.
