@[https://www.aptitudesoftware.com/the-evolution-of-it-finance-architecture/]
  - CEOs and CFOs remain focused on driving business performance and 
    identifying opportunities to improve bottom line results. The right IT 
    finance architecture gives a company both the confidence to report how 
    the company makes money and the data-driven insights to make even more 
    money – so why are so many firms challenged to get the finance systems 
    that can give
    - Control over accounting
    - Data-centricity
    - Timeliness

- Creating a reliable, distributed ledger of exchange
@[https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/20/developing-a-global-financial-architecture/]
  - "People want to see that the money they send across borders is going where it is supposed to."
  - The movement of capital around the globe is of paramount importance to an 
    increasingly globalized society.
  - Compiling robust credit files and using unique identifiers.
  - You shouldn’t have to pay to use the money you already own.

<span xsmall>Financial instruments Classification</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument]
Main classification:
  * Cash instruments – instruments whose value is determined directly by 
    the markets @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)]
    They can be securities @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)],
    which are readily transferable, and instruments such as
  @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans] and
    deposits @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_(finance)], where both borrower 
    and lender have to agree on a transfer.
  
  * <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)" title="Derivative (finance)">Derivative instruments</a> – 
    instruments which derive their value from the value and characteristics 
    of one or more underlying entities such as an <a href="/wiki/Asset" title="Asset">asset</a>,
    index, or <a href="/wiki/Interest_rate" title="Interest rate">interest rate</a>.
    They can be <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#OTC_and_exchange-traded" title="Derivative (finance)">exchange-traded derivatives</a> 
    and <a href="/wiki/Derivative_(finance)#OTC_and_exchange-traded" title="Derivative (finance)">over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives</a>.


Alternatively, financial instruments may be categorized by "asset class" 
depending on whether they are equity-based (reflecting <a href="/wiki/Ownership" title="Ownership">ownership</a>
of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). 
If the instrument is debt, it can be further categorised into short-term (
less than one year) or long-term. Foreign exchange instruments and 
transactions are neither debt- nor equity-based and belong in their own category.

<span xsmall>Understanding</span>
<span xsmall>Banking Comunication</span>
<span xsmall>(EBICS, Host-to-Host, SWIFT)</span>
@[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-banking-communication-three-channels-ebics-gross]
Banking communication can be very complex and even confusing, especially when 
it comes to payments. Even people who work with payments on a daily basis 
often don?t understand the specific technical details behind them. After all, 
they are finance experts, working in accounting and treasury, and not payment 
technology experts. So how do we best determine the right setup for a 
company?

The three main channels
Which payment communication channels exist? Before you consider specific 
solutions or combinations for a company, you should take a closer look at 
what is actually available.

ºEBICSº
EBICS is the German payments standard and is regulated by "Deutsche 
Kreditwirtschaft (DK)," a consortium made up of the Official Associations of 
a number of German bank types. It represents a very powerful combination of a 
standard channel and a standard format (SEPA, previously DTAUS). 
Communication is based on the TCP/IP Protocol. Authorized signatories are 
specified in the EBICS contracts and their signatures are called up for any 
communication with the banking server. Only once these signatures have been 
validated in connection with the type of instruction communicated at the same 
time (e.g. CCT for the SEPA DK format) does the banking server accept the 
file and log the result.

The back-ends of German banks are set up to meet the requirements of this 
communication method perfectly. All German banks use the EBICS standard, 
making it the most commonly used channel for payments within Germany.

ºHost-to-host (H2H)º
A so-called host-to-host connection essentially represents a bilateral 
agreement between a company and a bank to exchange information. The bank 
defines the standard for the company. Generally, these connections are based 
on SFTP and HTTPS protocols that are already encrypted (SSH or SSL). However, 
some banks require additional file encryption with OpenPGP. There is a Single 
Point of Entry, i.e. a central interface, and the bank then forwards the 
information to their branches worldwide. The disadvantage of this solution is 
the lack of a clearly defined, common standard. Moreover, this solution is 
more complex to set up and requires more involvement by internal IT. The 
advantage is that the absence of regulation means no friction losses. Host-to-
host can be a very good solution for global payments, in particular if a 
company works with only a few main banks.

ºSWIFTº
SWIFT is in a way a combination of EBICS and host-to-host. SWIFT has 
introduced SCORE (Standardised Corporate Environment), a clearly defined 
standard with clear rules for global payments. They specify in detail which 
financial messages may be exchanged by companies and financial institutes. A 
so-called SCORE Agreement needs to be drawn up; this is necessary but pretty 
straightforward. Once the agreement has been signed, corporates are 
authenticated in the SWIFT Network based on their company-own BIC. The 
infrastructure required for this is either supplied by a SaaS provider, a 
SWIFT Service Bureau or a local installation set up by internal IT. Unlike 
with EBICS and comparable to host-to-host, this means communicating globally 
with the banks? back-ends and forwarding files to the international branches. 
This solution makes sense if a company uses many different banks worldwide.

In reality, most companies use a combination of these solutions. The 
following example illustrates this: A company works with 20 banks in Germany 
and has therefore set up EBICS incl. SEPA. In addition, they have one main 
bank through which they process 70% of their global payments. For this, they 
use a host-to-host connection. For the remaining 30% of payments the company 
works with other global banks and has set up SWIFT to do so. Each company 
requires a detailed analysis of their banking landscape and needs to work out 
which volume of payments will make a host-to-host connection useful.

So why do many companies struggle to find the right payments solution? One of 
the problems is that quite often the only person they can turn to for advice 
is a member of the bank?s sales team. Here, they get information but they don?
t understand the technology behind the proposed solutions, and this makes it 
very difficult to form a neutral opinion. This is why it can make great sense 
to also talk to, for example, the provider of a treasury management system. 
The technology is there but companies need to make the best possible use of it
, and for this they require background information

<span xsmall>SWIFT</span>
BºHistory of Swift creation:º
  (Summary from: @[https://www-bbc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-50069985])
  - Citibank, London, 1960s.:
    payment instructions are inserted into a canister and sent
    upstairs via vacuum tube.  On the second floor, a team confirms 
    the TXs and sent their authorisations back down the pipe.
    - If turned out that the vacuum tube had become blocked.
  
  - ☞ Confirming large financial transactions is hard. 
    even harder across national or international borders. 
    - first half of the 19th Century: telegraph used for remote TXs.
      - "quick but buggy":  
        June 1887, "BAY ALL KINDS QUO" → "BUY ALL KINDS QUO" costed
        $20,000 (several million dollars in today's terms)
  
    - 1940+: banks used telex machines, making efficient use of
      telegraph lines. Making messages secure added enormous complexity.
      (former military signalmen hired to do the task)
      "For every single telex sent, you had to manually calculate
       what this telex test key was. When you received the tested telex,
       you had to do the reverse calculation to make sure the telex
       hadn't been tampered with during transmit and receive cycles.
       It was incredibly prone to human error."
    - 1970s: A better solution was needed - Especially in Europe-
      - American banks pushing their own proprietary system, called Marti.
        but not accepted in Europe.(feared o being locked to standards
        owned by a rival). A new private company, the "Society for Worldwide
        Interbank Telecommunication" (Swift) was created:
        - initially between 270 banks across 15 countries. 
        -BºIt simply provided a messaging service, using a standardisedº
         Bºformat that minimised errors and dramatically simplified º
         Bºproceedings.º
        - Computing company Burroughs installed Swift's dedicated
          computers and connections in Montreal, New York, and 13
          European banking centres. 
        WºEach nation's banks would plug into those central hubsº.
     - Today: SWIFT Underlying hardware and software continues to change.
       - transmitting and storing 7.8 billion highly sensitive 
         cross-border banking instructions last year. 
       - co-operative structure of the institution:
         - 9.000 member banks and financial institutions currently 
           agree standards and resolve disagreements.
       -RºHacks, outages and other problems have occurredº
         - often weaknesses in the systems of banks from smaller/poorer
           nations.
  
      The big grey boxes which helped build the internet
  
     But having largely solved one problem, Swift may have created another.
  
   Rº"RISKs":º
     - Want to track terrorist financing?
       Examine the Swift database.
     - Want to destroy the Iranian economy?
       Tell Swift to deny access to their banks.
     - Swift has found itself unable to resist direct orders from 
       the US, even when the EU disagrees.
     Rº"...Swift isn't interested in geopolitics, but geopoliticsº
     Rºis interested in Swift..."                                º

<span xsmall>SWIFT GPI</span>
@[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/swift-payments-reinvented-wim-raymaekers/]
@[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/making-cross-border-payments-fly-marc-delbaere/]
cross-border payments.

Statistics:
 - $40 trillion gpi payments sent in 2018
 - 56%+ of all SWIFT payments are now sent on gpi
 - All payments on SWIFT are tracked end-to-end,
   thanks to the Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference 
 - Same day credit to the end beneficiary of nearly all payments:
   - 50% within 30 minutes;
   - 40% credited within 5 minutes; many in just seconds
 - $300+ billion carried over gpi every day across 1,100+ 
   country corridors, representing 80% of all SWIFT cross-border payments 
   (and growing!)
 - Tracking payments across 55 networks and market infrastructures

- Currently, when a payment is received by a gpi bank, those payments are 
  confirmed by a credit transfer, providing end-to-end visibility and 
  tracking to the sender, cutting down on investigations and improving 
  customer service.

- By the end of 2020, all SWIFT institutions will also be able to confirm 
  inbound payments. To facilitate this, this year we are introducing a simple 
  version of the gpi Tracker. When realised, our ‘Tracker for all’ vision 
  will help ensure all financial institutions have access to payment tracking 
  and updating capabilities, bringing the benefits of gpi to the whole community.

(Wim Raymaekers, gpi programme director at SWIFT)
""" Our aim is to make cross border payments to be as seamless
    for banks as domestic payments."""
""" this year will see SWIFT address one of the 
   ºmajor pain pointsº for banks: payments getting stuck in
    transit due to inaccurate beneficiary account information
    ...  initiating banks will be able to access a real-time
    API-based mechanism, enabling them to seamlessly check beneficiary 
    account information with the ultimate receiving banks. 
    ... allowing banks to remedy any inaccurate or missing information
    instantly"
   ºAnother major pain pointº: we’re aiming to tackle:
   - exceptions and investigations: 
     - chasing up missing payments with counterparties is a source of frustration.
       It's a labour intensive and costly exercise, which adds complexity and
       unnecessary process loops into payment transactions. 
     - A new case resolution servicewill allow gpi banks to easily and
       quickly investigate payments to get to the bottom of the problem
       and resolve any issues.
"""

   - Solving pain points for corporate treasurers:
     - in mid-2019 we will open up gpi to corporate treasurers,
       enabling corporates to initiate and track gpi payments
       across all of their banking portals through a single window
      ºin their treasury management and ERP systemsº
     - SWIFT will allow major multi-banked corporates to solve some of 
       their key challenges such as improving liquidity management,
       receiving payment confirmations, ºoptimising payments routesº
       and getting more value out of their banking relationships. 

ºENABLING E-COMMERCE WITH gpiº
- (proof of concept state): 
  - it will allow participants involved in closed trade transactions
    on DLT (and non-DLT) ecosystems to settle the payment leg of
    their trades using gpi and benefit from fast, secure settlement 
    using a fiat currency.

<span xsmall>SWIFT Blockchain PoC</span>
@[https://www.blockchaindailynews.com/SWIFT-Blockchain-PoC-Final-Verdict-Back-office-Standardisation-prerequisite-for-DLT-adoption_a26324.html]
  In December 2017, I wrote about the SWIFT Blockchain Proof of concept (PoC
  ), and why I felt that the result was most likely going to be "DLT for 
  international payments processing is still work in progress ".
  SWIFT finally released the results of the PoC this month and have confirmed 
  that there is a lot more work needed within Banks' back office technology 
  and operational processes for DLT to be relevant.
  The PoC was aimed at international payments and how intraday/real time 
  liquidity management could be performed using DLT. Correspondent banks 
  provide services on behalf of another overseas financial institution 
  through a correspondent account (Nostro/ Vostro account). However, about 34%
  of the cost of an international payment is related to Nostro trapped 
  liquidity. This is due to the lack of real-time data to optimize intraday 
  liquidity management.
  Managing Nostro accounts and ensuring there is no over funding or overusage 
  of credit lines depend on availability of real time data. A real-time feed 
  of transaction data would allow banks to release payments to customers 
  quicker, whilst reducing liquidity risks.
  With that as the driver behind the initiative, a consortium of 34 banks 
  worked on this use case with SWIFT. In Q1 2017 SWIFT had launched their 
  Global Payments Initiative (GPI) with these banks and it went live without 
  DLT. SWIFT wanted to get their product out using legacy systems, and not 
  wait for the results of the DLT prototype.

  The results of the DLT prototype are as follows:
  | Nostro DLT application, combined with the ISO 20022 data model, delivered the 
  | business functionalities and data richness required for automated real-time 
  | liquidity monitoring and reconciliation. Real-time confirmation of each account
  | entry and use of the unique end-to-end transaction reference (UETR) - SWIFT's 
  | central payments tracker, made it possible.
  | 
  | Further progress is needed on DLT technology before it is ready to support 
  | applications in large scale critical global infrastructures. 528 channels were 
  | required in the PoC to ensure Nostro accounts would only be stored on the nodes
  |  of their account servicers and owners. But when the solution is in production,
  |  more than 100,000 such channels would need to be defined. DLT solution hasn't 
  | matured yet to handle that load
  | 
  | All Nostro Account service providers will need to migrate their back-office liq
  | uidity reporting process from Batch to real time processing. ISO 20022, will ne
  | ed to be applied across banks to ensure data shared across different banks has 
  | consistent data elements. Such a common data model is essential to reduce integ
  | ration costs (between SWIFT and the banks).
  | 
  | We will continue our R⅋D efforts to ensure that SWIFT customers will be able to
  |  leverage their existing SWIFT infrastructure and connectivity to benefit from 
  | blockchain services, whether offered by SWIFT or by third parties, on a secure 
  | and trusted platform.
  | Stephen Gilderdale, Chief Platform Officer, SWIFT
  | 
  | While the existing GPI has been successful for SWIFT, for the GPI to use DLT, i
  | t requires all banks to have a real time infrastructure. SWIFT is currently foc
  | used on helping that transformation happen.
  | Adoption of ISO 20022 is a pre-requisite to save costs before DLT can be beta t
  | ested for wider adoption. As this progresses, SWIFT will continue to explore ad
  | vancements within the DLT space to ensure there are no non-functional performan
  | ce/scaling challenges.
  | I see this as a major setback for banks' adoption of Blockchain. If banks' back
  |  office processes and technologies need to be transformed before DLT can be use
  | d, we may have to wait for a good part of another decade.
  | The official press release mentions that it is a question of "when rather than 
  | an if" for DLT to be used in this context. However, I believe that is a gross u
  | nderestimation of banks' inability to transform their back office technology an
  | d operational processes.

Electronic funds transfer at point of sale (EFTPOS /ˈɛftpɒs/) is an 
electronic payment system involving electronic funds transfers based on the 
use of payment cards, such as debit or credit cards, at payment terminals 
located at points of sale. EFTPOS technology originated in the United States 
in 1981 and was adopted by other countries. In Australia and New Zealand, it 
is also the brand name of a specific system used for such payments; these 
systems are mainly country specific and do not interconnect.

Debit and credit cards are embossed plastic cards complying with ISO/IEC 7810 
ID-1 standard. The cards have an embossed bank card number conforming with 
the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard.

The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol is an electronic communications
protocol initiated in 1992 for international real-time exchange of information 
related to the securities transactions and markets. With trillions of dollars 
traded annually on the NASDAQ alone, financial service entities are investing 
heavily in optimizing electronic trading and employing direct market access (DMA)
 to increase their speed to financial markets. Managing the delivery of trading
applications and keeping latency low increasingly requires an understanding of 
the FIX protocol.

    - Extremely short lived jobs. A short-lived job might rely on exiting
      quickly to free the resources (e.g. heap memory). In this case, accepting
      the GC cycle to futilely clean up the heap is a waste of time, because the heap
      would be freed on exit anyway. Note that the GC cycle might take a while, 
      because it would depend on the amount of live data in the heap, which can be
      a lot.

S4 (Applicability Statement 4) is a Conformance Profile of the OASIS ebMS 3.0 
specification,[1] and represents an open standard for the secure and payload-agnostic
exchange of Business-to-business documents using Web services. Secure document 
exchange is governed by aspects of WS-Security, including XML Encryption and 
XML Digital Signatures. Payload agnosticism refers to the document type (e.g. 
purchase order, invoice, etc.) not being tied to any defined SOAP action or 
operation.

AS4 became a standard in 2013.[2] The majority of the AS4 profiling points 
constraining the ebMS 3.0 specification are based upon the functional 
requirements of the AS2 specification. By scaling back ebMS 3.0 using AS2 as 
a blueprint, AS4 provides an entry-level on-ramp for Web services B2B by 
simplifying the complexities of Web services.[clarification needed]

Key Technical Highlights

    Support for SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 enveloping structure
    Payload agnosticism
    Support for single or multiple payloads contained either within the SOAP 
        body or as SOAP attachment(s)
    Support for payload compression
    Support for message-level security including various combinations of XML 
        Digital Signature and/or XML Encryption
    Support for X.509 security tokens and username/password tokens
    Support for business receipt of non-repudiation similar to the Message 
        Disposition Notification (MDN)[3] used by AS2 and specified as an XML 
        schema by the ebXML BPSS group
    Support for the ebMS 3.0 One-Way/Push message exchange pattern with support
        for either synchronous or asynchronous responses
    Support for the ebMS 3.0 One-Way/Pull message exchange pattern which is 
        beneficial for exchanging documents with non-addressable endpoints

-fast and secure off-line contactless transaction
@[https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-keyple]

Calypso is a set of specifications describing a fast and secure off-line 
contactless transaction, between a portable object and a terminal. It has 
been created at the end of the 1990s by some european public transport 
operators or authority (RATP and SNCF in Paris and all France, STIB in 
Brussels, OTLIS in Lisbon, ACTV in Venice, Konstanz in Germany), in order to 
create an open , interoperable and secure standard independent from 
industrials to ensure a real competition.

Today Calypso represent 20% of the world market of contactless smart 
ticketing in 25 countries and 125 cities. It brings to his user a guarantee 
of security and interoperability which relies on a total compliance with 
existing standards  (ISO 14443, ISO 7816-4, Global Platform). The Calypso 
standard is managed by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) , which is led 
by transports operators and public authorities in order to ensure openness 
and independence from industrials in confront of other proprietary schemes.

The openness for a contactless ticketing standard can be evaluated for the 
two mains components of ticketing systems, with the complementary concern 
about guarantee of security:

    Cards and portable objects (mobile phones, Java objects, wearables, …)
    Terminals (validators, vending equipment, …)

<span xsmall>Modeling Language</span>
<span xsmall>for Finance</span>

Developed by the company LexiFi, the Modeling Language for Finance (MLFi) is 
the first formal language that accurately describes the most sophisticated 
capital market, credit, and investment products. MLFi is implemented as an 
extension of OCaml.

MLFi users derive two important benefits from a functional programming 
approach. First, the declarative formalism of functional programming 
languages is well suited for specifying complex data structures and algorithms
. Second, functional programming languages have strong list processing 
capabilities. Lists play a central role in finance where they are used 
extensively to define contract event and payment schedules.

In addition, MLFi provides crucial business integration capabilities 
inherited from OCaml and related tools and libraries. This enables users, for 
example, to interoperate with C and Java programs, manipulate XML schemas and 
documents, and interface with SQL databases.

Data models and object models aiming to encapsulate the definitions and 
behavior of financial instruments were developed by the banking industry over 
the past two decades, but face inherent limitations that OCaml helped 
overcome.

LexiFi's approach to modeling complex financial contracts received an 
academic award in 2000, and the MLFi implementation was elected “Software 
Product of the Year 2001” by the magazine Risk, the leading financial trading 
and risk management publication. MLFi-based solutions are gaining growing 
acceptance throughout Europe and are contributing to spread the use of OCaml 
in the financial services industry

as subsequently amended[2] is a European Union law that provides 
harmonised regulation for investment services across the 31 member states of 
the European Economic Area (the 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Norway and 
Liechtenstein). The directive's main objectives are to increase competition 
and consumer protection in investment services. As of the effective date, 1 
November 2007, it replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD).[3] 
  MiFID II (the update to MiFID and introduction of MiFIR) comes into effect 
on the 3rd January 2018. The changes are broad-reaching, covering multiple 
asset classes and a significant part of the trade lifecycle. FIX Trading 
Community has, over the last few years, engaged in a number of the topics 
covered by MiFID II and is well placed to assist the industry – practitioners
, regulators and solution providers – in a number of key topics.
  To this end, FIX Trading Community™ has a number of MiFID-related

@[https://www.evry.com/en/news/articles/psd2-the-directive-that-will-change-banking-as-we-know-it/]
It introduces two new types of players to the financial landscape: PISP and AISP.
AISP (Account Information Service Provider) are the service providers with 
access to the account information of bank customers. Such services could analyze
a user’s spending behavior or aggregate a user’s account information from 
several banks into one overview. PISP (Payment Initiation Service Provider) are
the service providers initiating a payment on behalf of the user. P2P transfer 
and bill payment are PISP services we are likely to see when PSD2 is implemented.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords">Basel Accords</a>
Target: minimize the debt of financial entities and guarantee their capacity 
        to react against operational, credit and market risks.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_I">Basel I (1988)</a>
Basel_I:
  Estableció unos principios básicos en los que debía fundamentarse la actividad 
bancaria como el capital regulatorio, requisito de permanencia, capacidad de 
absorción de pérdidas y de protección ante quiebra. Este capital debía ser
suficiente para hacer frente a los riesgos de crédito, mercado y tipo de cambio.

  El acuerdo establecía también que el capital mínimo de la entidad bancaria debía
ser el 8% del total de los activos de riesgo (crédito, mercado y tipo de cambio 
sumados).

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II">Basel I (2004):</a>
 Desarrolla de manera más extensa el cálculo de los activos ponderados
por riesgo y permitía que las entidades bancarias aplicaran calificaciones
de riesgo basadas en sus modelos internos, siempre que estuviesen 
previamente aprobadas por el supervisor. 

 Este acuerdo incorporaba, por lo tanto, nuevas tendencias en la medición
y el seguimiento de las distintas clases de riesgo. Se hizo énfasis en
metodologías internas, revisión de la supervisión y disciplina de mercado.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_III">Basel I (2010):</a>
  Intentó adaptarse a la magnitud de la crisis económica, atendiendo
a la exposición de gran parte de los bancos de todo el mundo a los
"activos tóxicos" en los balances de los bancos y en los derivados que
circulaban en el mercado. 
  El temor al efecto dominó que pudiera causar la insolvencia de los bancos,
hizo que se establecieron nuevas recomendaciones como:

  - Endurecimiento de los criterios y aumento de la calidad del volumen de
    capital para asegurar su mayor capacidad para absorber pérdidas.

  - Modificación de los criterios de cálculo de los riesgos para disminuir
    el nivel de exposición real.

  - Constitución de colchones de capital durante los buenos tiempos que 
    permitan hacer frente el cambio de ciclo económico. 

  - Introducción de un nuevo ratio de apalancamiento como medida complementaria 
    al ratio de solvencia.

<a href="https://blog.powerdata.es/el-valor-de-la-gestion-de-datos/bid/307135/La-gesti-n-de-metadatos-en-los-Acuerdos-de-Basilea">La gestión de metadatos en los Acuerdos de Basilea:</a>
  El requerimiento de transparencia de los Acuerdos de Basilea y la necesidad de
justificar un valor a auditores externos hace necesaria la capacidad de rastrear
la información con precisión y por eso proponemos la reutilización de los metadatos
de la organización o la implementación de nuevos metadatos para evitar posibles
retrasos en el día a día de la organización cada vez que haya que recabar información
para explicar un valor.

Basilea II establece las condiciones mínimas que una entidad bancaria debe tener 
para asegurar su estabilidad en un ecosistema económico mundial.

Aparte de satisfacer S10-6 (Basel Supervisory), una buena Gestión de Metadatos permite
analizar el curso de los datos en vertical y en horizontal desde la fuente, pasando
por las funciones de transformación hasta el informe en la capa de Reporting

Otro de los beneficios de la gestión de metadatos es la capacidad de hacer análisis
de impacto de forma automática. Esto supone la capacidad de ver cómo impacta un
cambio en el ecosistema de aplicaciones. Por ejemplo, un cambio en los datos de un
cliente en una aplicación front-end pueden ocasionar un conflicto con los contratos
o los procesos asociados a ese mismo cliente en otra aplicación de back-office y
eso podría generar inconsistencias operacionales, descuadres e incidencias serias en la 
capa de reporting.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCBS_239">BCBS 239</a>
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's standard number 239. 
The subject title of the standard is: "Principles for effective risk data 
aggregation and risk reporting". The overall objective of the standard is to 
strengthen banks’ risk data aggregation capabilities and internal risk 
reporting practices, in turn, enhancing the risk management and decision 
making processes at banks.[1]

Europe GDP settled every 5 days.

TARGET2 is based on a technically centralised platform ? the SSP ? and all 
users, irrespective of their location, have access to the same services, 
functionalities and inter faces at the same price.

The SSP of TARGET2 was set up using a modular approach. Every module in the 
SSP is closely related to a specific service (e.g. the Payments Module for 
the processing of payments). Some of the modules (Home Accounting, Standing 
Facilities and Reserve Management Modules) can be used by individual central 
banks on an optional basis. Central banks that do not use these modules offer 
the respective services via proprietary applications in their domestic 
technical environments.  SWIFT standards and services (e.g. FIN, InterAct, 
FileAct and Browse) are used to enable standardised communication between the 
TARGET2 system and its participants. Since November 2010 TARGET2 has also 
offered internet-based access for low-volume participants 

FROM http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2/shared/pdf/professionals/release_12/Communication_for_the_SSP_release_12_0_1st_User_consultation.pdf 

- it might be necessary to connect TARGET2 to TARGET Instant Payment Settlement
(TIPS) if the implementation of TIPS (currently under investigation) is 
confirmed by the Governing Council. 
One more, although minor, amendment of TARGET2  already foreseen for release 
12.0 is the update of the SWIFT standard for BICs 
(update of ISO 9362standard)?
TIPS: TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS)
New service for the settlement of instant payments, enabling payment service 
providers to offer fund transfers in real time and around the clock, 365 days 
a year.
Instant payments will increase the speed of euro payments in the European 
Union. Today it takes up to one business day for a payment in euro to reach 
the beneficiary . 
With instant payments, the funds will be available immediately for use by the 
recipient, 24/7/365.
From an end-user perspective, the benefit of instant payments is the ability 
to make time-sensitive payments immediately, wherever and whenever necessary. 
The implementation of instant payments may also provide the basis for service 
enhancements and value-added services, e.g. person-to-person mobile 
payments.
Payment service providers are encouraged to make instant payment solutions in 
euro available at a pan-European level as of November 2017. Although it is 
not mandatory for payment service providers to offer SCTinst, it is expected 
that a large number of them will do so.
The TIPS pricing policy will favour reachability. The entry and maintenance 
fees for an account in TIPS will be set at zero. The charges to be paid per 
transaction will be proportional to the volume of instant payments processed 
via TIPS in order to comply with our full cost recovery principle. In this 
context, the feedback on expected volumes in the market consultation was very 
encouraging. It exceeded the volumes initially estimated by the Eurosystem 
both as regards total market volumes and the volumes that market participants 
would expect to process in TIPS. The Eurosystem will offer the service to 
banks at the price of a maximum of 0.20 eurocent (?0.0020) per payment for at 
least the first two years of operation.

<a xsmall href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/financial-products-and-services/payments-transfers-cheques/index_en.htm">EU Payments, transfers and cheques</a>
When you make a cross-border payment in euros, Romanian lei and Swedish krona within the EU, your bank can't charge you more than it would for an equivalent national transaction. Even banks based in EU countries outside the euro area must apply this rule.

This includes any:

    transfers between bank accounts in different EU countries
    withdrawals from cash machines/ATMs in EU countries
    payments by debit or credit card across the EU
    direct debit transactions

For example, if your bank charges you 1 EUR each time you withdraw money in your home country from a cash machine outside your bank network, they can charge you the same amount when you make a withdrawal in another EU country.
Charges for using your card

When you pay for something in the EU using your credit or debit card, traders and banks cannot charge you an extra fee – also known as "surcharging" – just for using a particular card. This rule applies to all card purchases (in shops and online) made within your home country or in another EU country.

American Express, Diners Club, and business or corporate credit cards, where your employer is billed instead of you, are not covered by EU rules on payment services, and you can still be charged extra for using these cards.

You should be aware that if you're paying in EU currencies other than euros, you may still be charged a currency conversion fee by your card provider when you use your card in another country.
Sample story
You shouldn't be charged extra for using your card

Clara from Austria wanted to buy flight tickets online. She selected her tickets on the airline's website and went to pay. However, when she entered her credit card information, the airline added an extra EUR 10 to the cost of her order as a charge for using a VISA card.

Clara contacted her local European Consumer Centre, who raised a complaint with the airline. The airline refunded the EUR 10 charge for her booking, and modified their rules to remove the illegal surcharge from their booking process.
Card and payment fraud

EU rules limit the amount you can be asked to pay if you're the victim of card or payment fraud – where your card or your account is debited without your permission. In all cases, you can only be asked to pay a maximum of EUR 50 towards the cost of the fraudulent payments.

However, in cases where you were unaware of the loss, theft or misappropriation of funds (i.e. your account was hacked, or your card was cloned and charged without your knowledge), then you don't have to pay anything. Your bank or card provider should cover all the costs. This rule also applies if the loss was caused by a bank employee.
Blocked money on your card

Sometimes when you make a reservation, such as a hotel booking or car rental, you may be asked to give your card details to guarantee your booking. The trader may also ask to block a certain amount of money on your card when you make your reservation. This means  the trader reserves part of your credit limit or account balance  to cover any charge they expect you to build up, such as room service in a hotel, or possible damage to a hire car.

You should be informed by the trader if they intend to block an amount on your credit card, and you must give your approval for this and for the exact amount being blocked.

As soon as you have made the real payment – for example, when you check out of your hotel and use your credit card to pay for your room, or when you return your hire car and pay the final bill – the bank must immediately release the blocked amount from your credit card.  
Sample story
Blocked amounts must be released as soon as you pay

Boris from Hungary went to Venice for the weekend with his girlfriend. When they arrived at their hotel, the hotel took a copy of Boris' credit card. The hotel informed Boris that they would like to block EUR 500 to cover his reservation and any use of the mini-bar and restaurant services during their stay. Boris agreed to have his card blocked with this amount.

Before leaving the hotel, Boris paid his hotel bill using his credit card. A week later, when he tried to book some flights with his credit card, Boris realised that EUR 500 was still blocked on his credit card. He called the hotel to complain, who apologised for their mistake and immediately asked the bank to release the blocked amount.
Direct debits

If you have a direct debit set up from your bank account, it  may happen that a payment is made by mistake or the wrong amount is taken – for example if you cancelled a contract with a supplier, but the direct debit was still made after the contract was terminated. In these situations, you have the right to get a payment refunded within 8 weeks. This applies to all direct debits, both within your home country and cross-border direct debits within the EU.
What to do if you have a problem

If you have any problems making payments within the EU, you should contact your bank or card provider. They must give a written response to your complaint within 15 days (or up to 35 days in certain exceptional circumstances). They should also have a formal complaints procedure in place for consumers.

If you need any help getting your rights recognised, you can contact FIN-NET for problems with financial service providers, or ECC-Net for problems with traders.
Cheques

EU rules on bank charges for international and national payments do not apply to cheques.

There are sometimes very high transaction fees for cashing a cheque from another EU country. In many countries, cheques are also no longer accepted as a means of payment.

LMAX aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world. Clearly, in order 
to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency 
and high-throughput with our Java platform. Performance testing showed that 
using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency
, so we focused on optimising this area

The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing. We found that cache 
misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both 
extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" 
for the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free.

<span xsmall>Clearing vs Settlement</span>
C&P from: 
@[https://connector.interledger4j.dev/concepts/settlement-xrp-ledger]
Payment systems like Interledger can generally be separated into two 
layers:
- A ºhigher-performance CLEARING layer, where value is 
  transferred in a provisional manner; and a
-ºlower-performance SETTLEMENT layerº, which resolves any
  liabilities between counterparties accrued in the clearing
  layer. 

- Most payments systems are organized in this way, and because many 
  payment systems are often stacked on top of each other, it is common 
  to see that one system's "settlement layer" is comprised of another 
  system with its own clearing and settlement system. Ex:
  from a consumer perspective, credit-card processors like Visa and 
  Mastercard can be viewed as a "clearing systems" (swiping the card at 
  a merchant) with an underlying settlement system to allow you to 
  settle your debt to the credit card company each month (e.g., by 
  making a payment from your bank account). What's interesting to see 
  is that the system that appears to be a "settlement" system (i.e., 
  the banking system) is actually comprised of its own clearing and 
  settlement layers. For example, the bank's databases (i.e., the 
  clearing system) and the Federal Reserve system (i.e., the settlement 
  system).

  ...
  Example settlement layer systems include:
  - Offline fiat systems (e.g., cash or paper check)
  - Direct asset transfers (e.g., a shipment of gold)
  - Electronic ledgers (e.g., bank ledger, PayPal, Venmo)
  - Electronic payment networks (e.g., SWIFT, ACH, SEPA, Visa, 
    Mastercard)
  - Cryptocurrency ledgers (e.g., Bitcoin or XRPL)
  - Signing and exchanging payment channel claims (e.g., XRP Paychan)

What is PCI level 1 compliance and why do you need to know?

If you sell anything online - or even just follow the news related to recent credit card fraud - you’re probably aware that there are standards governing online payments. When those standards are violated, massive opportunities for fraud can occur. As an online merchant, it is critical to take measures to protect customer card data. The success of your business depends on it.

Fortunately, there’s a set of established rules to protect customer card data. It is called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and it is governed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). These rules are better known in our business vernacular as PCI compliance.

@[https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/blog/posts/gs-releases-new-open-source-projects.html]
Goldman Sachs has launched three of its latest open source projects – 
- Jrpip 
Jrpip implements remote interface method invocation which allows different 
Java processes to interact with one another. The product was designed to 
increase developer efficiency by providing useful features, such as the ability to deploy in any servlet container, interface implementation that doesn’t require RemoteException and automatic retries with once-execute semantics. Additionally, Jrpip uses an efficient binary protocol that is streamed, reducing memory consumption and garbage collector issues. “We hope the open source community finds Jrpip to be a useful Java library,” said Mohammad, a vice president and technology fellow in the Technology Division. “With Jrpip, the developers can concentrate on their code instead of worrying about network plumbing and TCP errors.”
- Obevo
Obevo is a database deployment tool that helps teams manage database changes in their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process. In addition to handling production deployments, Obevo aids the development phase by defining a clean structure to maintain DB object code, and helps the testing phase with features such as in-memory database conversion. Notably, Obevo was designed for systems of enterprise scale and complexity and can manage hundreds of DB objects in a schema, while still handling new schemas in a simple manner. “We feel our ability to onboard a large and long-lived system to a clean SDLC process is a key differentiator in the open source space,” said Shant, a vice president in the Technology Division. “By publishing this to the open source community, we hope to aid others in their own DB deployment estates while growing a strong community around the tool.”


- Tablasco 

Tablasco is a JUnit rule that adds table verification to unit tests. For software products that produce large amounts of data, this tool can help to create automated tests that are both comprehensive and easy to maintain. Users only need to adapt their existing data to a table format that Tablasco understands. “Every test produces a color-coded HTML break report, which helps users quickly identify the issue,” said Barry, a vice president in the Technology Division. Furthermore, Tablasco features automated baseline management, allowing users to easily update the baseline file of a failing test.

est Techniques

- Fraud detection techniques mostly stem from the anomaly detection branch of data science.
- If the dataset has sufficient number of fraud examples, supervised machine learning algorithms for classification like random forest, logistic regression can be used for fraud detection.
- If the dataset has no fraud examples, we can use either the outlier detection approach using isolation forest technique or anomaly detection using the neural autoencoder.
- After the machine learning model has been trained, it's evaluated on the test set using metrics such as sensitivity and specificity, or Cohen’s Kappa.

   Financial Modeling – A financial model is simply a tool that’s 
   built in Excel to forecast a business’ financial performance into 
   the future.  The forecast is typically based on the company’s 
   historical performance, assumptions about the future, and requires 
   preparing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, 
   and supporting schedules (known as a 3 statement model). From there, 
   more advanced types of models can be built such as discounted cash 
   flow analysis (DCF model), leveraged-buyout (LBO), mergers and 
   acquisitions (M&A), and sensitivity analysis. Below is an example of 
   financial modeling in Excel.

   - What is a financial model used for?
   
     The output of a financial model is used for decision making and 
     performing financial analysis, whether inside or outside of the 
     company. Inside a company, executives will use financial models to 
     make decisions about:
     
     Raising capital (debt and/or equity)
     Making acquisitions (businesses and/or assets)
     Growing the business organically (e.g., opening new stores, entering new markets, etc.)
     Selling or divesting assets and business units
     Budgeting and forecasting (planning for the years ahead)
     Capital allocation (priority of which projects to invest in)
     Valuing a business


https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/types-of-financial-models/

There are many different types of financial models.  In this guide, 
we will outline the top 10 most common models used in corporate 
finance by financial modeling professionals.

Here is a list of the 10 most common types of financial models:

  Three Statement Model
  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
  Merger Model (M&A)
  Initial Public Offering (IPO) Model
  Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model
  Sum of the Parts Model
  Consolidation Model
  Budget Model
  Forecasting Model
  Option Pricing Model

Real-time Bidding (RTB) is a way of transacting media that allows an 
individual ad impression to be put up for bid in real-time. This is 
done through a programmatic on-the-spot auction, which is similar to 
how financial markets operate. RTB allows for Addressable

<span xsmall>X12 protocol</span>
https://boldvan.com/blog/x12-protocol/

- ANSI X12 EDI protocol in 1979.
- Inspired by the need for transmitting large quantities of data,
  the military and logistics companies were the first to utilize X12. 

- ANSI developed, maintained, promoted, and interpreted the applications
  of the X12 EDI protocol.

- Maintenance committee meets three times a year.
  3000+ standards experts from more than 300 companies.

-BºInitially designed to transmit massive batch transactions. X12'sº
 Bºuse now extends to include transaction processing in real-time. º

- government, finance, and logistics are among the 300,000+ businesses
  using it. BºIt is ubiquitous in health careº:
  - In 1996, Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act (HIPAA). X12 is the national HIPAA protocol and
    a mandate for health care transactions.

- Elements of X12:
  - Data: There are two types of data elements in X12 standards.
    - Simple: The X12 Data Element Dictionary defines a simple data 
      element as “A data element is equivalent to a field in a data 
      dictionary. Data elements have a name, a data element number, a brief 
      description, a data type, and a minimum and maximum length .”
    - Composite: Two or more simple elements divided by delimiter 
      characters (part of X12 syntax, also known as data element 
      separators). A telephone number is an example of composite data. Each 
      of the three data elements in a telephone number reveal different 
      information and must be in a uniformed order.

  - Segments
      Segments are logical groupings of data elements equivalent to record 
      types. Segments begin with two or three character tags that identify 
      what type of segments they are. Thus a field’s meaning may vary 
      based on the segment.

  - Loops
     Sets of segments that are ordered and related within a transaction set make up a loop.

China se preparara para su expulsión del sistema de pagos en 
dólares, en caso de que Estados Unidos sancione a las empresas y 
bancos chinos, tal como ha hecho con los rusos, dijo Fang Xinghai, 
vicepresidente de la Comisión Reguladora de Valores de China.

El sistema de pagos en dólares de Estados Unidos, que se basa en 
infraestructuras como el sistema internacional de mensajería de 
pagos Swift y el sistema de pagos interbancarios de la Cámara de 
Compensación (Chips), es la columna vertebral del comercio y las 
inversiones internacionales.

“La internacionalización del yuan es una necesidad para compensar 
la presión financiera externa”, añadió Fang. “Si nuestros 
activos en el extranjero se mantuvieran en yuanes, no habría tales 
preocupaciones” sobre la devaluación del dólar estadounidense.

El gobierno chino ha estado tratando de estimular el uso 
internacional del yuan durante la última década. Ha alcanzado la 
condición de moneda de reserva nominal después de haber sido 
incluida en la cesta de los Derechos Especiales de Giro, una unidad 
contable del Fondo Monetario Internacional, pero el uso 
transfronterizo real del yuan sigue siendo limitado frente al dólar.

La proporción de la moneda china en los pagos internacionales 
descendió al sexto lugar, con un 1,79 por ciento de la proporción 
mundial en mayo, muy por detrás del dólar de los Estados Unidos 
(40,88 por ciento), el euro (32,9 por ciento) y el yen japonés (3,53 
por ciento), según datos de Swift.

@[https://cryptoconsortium.github.io/CCSS/]
CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS) is a set of requirements for 
all information systems that make use of cryptocurrencies, including 
exchanges, web applications, and cryptocurrency storage solutions. By 
standardizing the techniques and methodologies used by systems around 
the globe, end-users will be able to easily make educated decisions 
about which products and services to use and with which companies 
they wish to align.

CCSS is designed to complement existing information security 
standards (i.e. ISO 27001:2013) by introducing guidance for security 
best practices with respect to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. CCSS 
is not designed to substitute or replace these standards; in fact, 
following the CCSS to the letter while ignoring standards like ISO 
27001:2013 will likely lead to compromise. CCSS is a cryptocurrency 
standard that augments standard information security practices. As 
with any standard, knowledgeable and experienced security 
professionals and/or auditors are necessary when implementing any 
information system to ensure coverage of all classes of attack as 
well as the appropriate handling of all potential risks.
