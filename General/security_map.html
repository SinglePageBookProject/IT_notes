<span xsmall>KPI/KRI/KCI Sec. Metrics</span>
@[https://opaq.com/newsroom/kpi-v-kri-v-kci-key-cyber-security-indicators/]

- Key performance indicator (KPI): Shows how the business is performing based on the goals and objectives leadership has set as well as the progress that is being made toward those goals. For security operations, this metric might be used in an effort to resolve open items or tackle a backlog of unresolved security investigations.
- Key risk indicator (KRI): Measures the company’s level of risk, and how its risk profile changes over time. An example for security operations is to use metrics that measure the severity of threats and vulnerabilities being reported by sensors. Another example is  to look for places in the security defensive chain events that are happening (e.g. end-point-based events are more “risky” than firewall or WAF events). Finally, make sure you have a good understanding as to business-role the assets involved play. Security events that occur on critical assets present more risk than those on noncritical ones.
- Key control indicator (KCI): Indicates how much control a company has over its environment and its level of risk, or how effectively a particular control is working. Putting this in context with IT security operations, a question to ask is whether you have the necessary controls across all areas of the business – for example, the NIST Cyber Security Framework functional areas (identify, protect, detect, respond and recover). Knowing that these functions have sufficient coverage throughout your defense in depth (devices, applications, networks, data and users) gives you a degree of confidence in your controls.

@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/09/eclipse-vulnerability-assessment/]
The Eclipse Foundation has a proposal to incorporate a Vulnerability 
Assessment Tool that helps developers identify which of their software 
dependencies contain known security issues from the Common Vulnerabilities 
and Exposure (CVE) database.

The tool assists teams identify otherwise harmful violations of OWASP's A9 
security issue, using components with known vulnerabilities. Without 
automated checks to monitor downstream libraries, many developers do not know 
when to upgrade components and may continue using libraries with known 
automated exploits, leading to system compromise and breaches.

<span xsmall>SIEM systems</span>
@[https://logz.io/blog/what-is-siem/]

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a security and auditing system comprised of different monitoring and analysis components. The recent rise in cyber attacks, together with tighter security regulations required from organizations, are making SIEM a standard security approach which is being adopted by an increasing amount of organizations.

@[https://logz.io/blog/open-source-siem-tools/]

Helping to protect IT environments from cyber attacks and comply with tightening compliance standards, SIEM systems are becoming the cornerstone for security paradigms implemented by a growing number of organizations.

In a previous post, we explained what a SIEM system actually is — why organizations require it to start with, the components it is comprised of, and how it helps mitigate attacks. One of the conclusions reached in that article was that SIEM is not actually a single tool in itself, but is instead comprised of multiple monitoring and analysis components.

There are proprietary platforms that do offer an all-in-one SIEM solution, such as LogRhythm, QRadar, and ArcSight. These solutions can become rather expensive, especially in the long run and in larger organizations, and so more and more companies are on the search for an open source SIEM platform.

But is there an open source platform that includes all the basic SIEM ingredients?

The simple answer is — no. There is no all-in-one perfect open source SIEM system. Existing solutions either lack core SIEM capabilities, such as event correlation and reporting or require combining with other tools. As always, though, there are some good contenders, and in this article, we take a look at six of these platforms.


<span xsmall>IBM QRadar SIEM</span>
IBM® QRadar® Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) helps security teams accurately detect and prioritize threats across the enterprise, and it provides intelligent insights that enable teams to respond quickly to reduce the impact of incidents. By consolidating log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout your network, QRadar correlates all this different information and aggregates related events into single alerts to accelerates incident analysis and remediation.  QRadar SIEM is available on premises and in a cloud environment.

Scientists Extract RSA Key From GnuPG Using Sound of CPU 264
Posted by Soulskill on Wednesday December 18, 2013 @06:05PM from the noisy-fans-are-now-a-feature dept.
kthreadd writes
"In their research paper titled RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis, Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir and Eran Tromer et al. present a method for extracting decryption keys from the GnuPG security suite using an interesting side-channel attack. By analysing the acoustic sound made by the CPU they were able to extract a 4096-bit RSA key in about an hour (PDF). A modern mobile phone placed next to the computer is sufficient to carry out the attack, but up to four meters have been successfully tested using specially designed microphones."

YARA in a nutshell                                                              rule silent_banker : banker
                                                                                {
YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to         meta:
identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions            description = "This is just an example"
of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or              thread_level = 3
binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings             in_the_wild = true
and a boolean expression which determine its logic. Let's see an example:       
                                                                                    strings:
                                                                                        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}
                                                                                        $b = {8D 4D B0 2B C1 83 C0 27 99 6A 4E 59 F7 F9}
                                                                                        $c = "UVODFRYSIHLNWPEJXQZAKCBGMT"
                                                                                
                                                                                    condition:
                                                                                        $a or $b or $c
                                                                                }

The above rule is telling YARA that any file containing one of the three 
strings must be reported as silent_banker. This is just a simple example, 
more complex and powerful rules can be created by using wild-cards, case-
insensitive strings, regular expressions, special operators and many other 
features that you'll find explained in YARA's documentation.

multi-platform, running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and can be 
used through its command-line interface or from your own Python scripts with 
the yara-python extension.

SAP has released the source code for Vulnerability Assessment Tool, a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that was tested internally for two years with 20,000 scans on more than 600 projects.

The Vulnerability Assessment Tool focuses specifically on the detection of vulnerable components as it is stated in OWASP-Top 10 2017 A9. The tool scans software packages for direct and transitive dependencies and then compares each dependency to known sources, like the National Vulnerability Database or CVE list, to determine if known vulnerabilities or exploits exist for each package. During development, this knowledge can inform developers on when they should upgrade certain components. During operations, when a new vulnerability is discovered, this information can be used to locate which applications require action.

Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.

We urge all companies to adopt this awareness document within their organization and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Adopting the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces secure code.

The National Security Agency (NSA) recently released the source code for their reverse-engineering tool, Ghidra, that enables cybersecurity specialists to disassemble and inspect applications from binaries without any code.

Ghidra runs on OpenJDK 11 and supports analysis of machine-level binaries across a range of architectures including servers and embedded systems. Security engineers often perform reverse-engineering activities to understand the behavior of malware or to develop exploits against applications.

Google descubre que todos los chips son vulnerables a Spectre y Meltdown

El malware suele aprovecharse de errores de codificación y diseños deficiente. Pero esta investigación revela un defecto básico en la propia naturaleza de la computación que podría hacer que algunas amenazas sean imposibles de solucionar

Mozilla Memory Scanning
""" Mozilla just announced a new security technology that will let you look 
into your server’s memory processes and it’s called Masche.  As you’d expect the code is open-source.  The tool scans memory processes, while allowing for normal unabated operations. Masche acts as a complement to Mozilla’s existing digital forensics and threat response platform Mozilla InvestiGator or MIG. The platform views information from thousands of hosts simultaneously, but cannot see into memory processes.  Masche’s technology makes up for this handicap. Mozilla says that while Masche provides fast memory scans, it doesn’t offer advanced forensic features, like Volatility or Rekall (two advanced forensics frameworks)."
"""

- <a href="https://code.google.com/p/volatility/">Google Volatility</a>
Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
versions and service packs including XP, 2003 Server, Vista
, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Seven, 8, 8.1, Server 2012, and 2012 R2.  
Whether your memory dump is in raw format, a Microsoft crash dump, 
hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot, Volatility is able to work 
with it. We also now support Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format and 
include 35+ plugins for analyzing 32- and 64-bit Linux kernels from 2.6.11 - 3
.16 and distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSuSE, Fedora, CentOS, and 
Mandrake. We support 38 versions of Mac OSX memory dumps from 10.5 to 10.9.4 
Mavericks, both 32- and 64-bit.  Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.  "

Semmle created LGTM, a continuous code analysis platform aimed to identify vulnerabilities in software systems. At the heart of LGTM lies Semmle QL, a query language and code search engine that enables code analysis to find and eradicate security vulnerabilities.

QL uses variant analysis, a technique security engineers typically use to identify vulnerabilities starting from a known vulnerability that is treated as a seed for the search process. In other words, once a vulnerability is identified through, e.g., pen-testing or other techniques, security researchers audit the rest of the code base to find similar problems. That is the process QL automates and extend across multiple code bases allowing developers to write queries that can be shared and reused. According to Semmle, their solutions have been used to identify thousands of vulnerabilities, including over 100 CVEs in open source projects.
