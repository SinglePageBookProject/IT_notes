<span xsmall>KPI/KRI/KCI Sec. Metrics</span>
@[https://opaq.com/newsroom/kpi-v-kri-v-kci-key-cyber-security-indicators/]

- Key performance indicator (KPI): Shows how the business is performing based on the goals and objectives leadership has set as well as the progress that is being made toward those goals. For security operations, this metric might be used in an effort to resolve open items or tackle a backlog of unresolved security investigations.
- Key risk indicator (KRI): Measures the company’s level of risk, and how its risk profile changes over time. An example for security operations is to use metrics that measure the severity of threats and vulnerabilities being reported by sensors. Another example is  to look for places in the security defensive chain events that are happening (e.g. end-point-based events are more “risky” than firewall or WAF events). Finally, make sure you have a good understanding as to business-role the assets involved play. Security events that occur on critical assets present more risk than those on noncritical ones.
- Key control indicator (KCI): Indicates how much control a company has over its environment and its level of risk, or how effectively a particular control is working. Putting this in context with IT security operations, a question to ask is whether you have the necessary controls across all areas of the business – for example, the NIST Cyber Security Framework functional areas (identify, protect, detect, respond and recover). Knowing that these functions have sufficient coverage throughout your defense in depth (devices, applications, networks, data and users) gives you a degree of confidence in your controls.

@[https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/09/eclipse-vulnerability-assessment/]
The Eclipse Foundation has a proposal to incorporate a Vulnerability 
Assessment Tool that helps developers identify which of their software 
dependencies contain known security issues from the Common Vulnerabilities 
and Exposure (CVE) database.

The tool assists teams identify otherwise harmful violations of OWASP's A9 
security issue, using components with known vulnerabilities. Without 
automated checks to monitor downstream libraries, many developers do not know 
when to upgrade components and may continue using libraries with known 
automated exploits, leading to system compromise and breaches.

<span xsmall>SIEM systems</span>
@[https://logz.io/blog/what-is-siem/]

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a security and auditing system comprised of different monitoring and analysis components. The recent rise in cyber attacks, together with tighter security regulations required from organizations, are making SIEM a standard security approach which is being adopted by an increasing amount of organizations.

@[https://logz.io/blog/open-source-siem-tools/]

Helping to protect IT environments from cyber attacks and comply with tightening compliance standards, SIEM systems are becoming the cornerstone for security paradigms implemented by a growing number of organizations.

In a previous post, we explained what a SIEM system actually is — why organizations require it to start with, the components it is comprised of, and how it helps mitigate attacks. One of the conclusions reached in that article was that SIEM is not actually a single tool in itself, but is instead comprised of multiple monitoring and analysis components.

There are proprietary platforms that do offer an all-in-one SIEM solution, such as LogRhythm, QRadar, and ArcSight. These solutions can become rather expensive, especially in the long run and in larger organizations, and so more and more companies are on the search for an open source SIEM platform.

But is there an open source platform that includes all the basic SIEM ingredients?

The simple answer is — no. There is no all-in-one perfect open source SIEM system. Existing solutions either lack core SIEM capabilities, such as event correlation and reporting or require combining with other tools. As always, though, there are some good contenders, and in this article, we take a look at six of these platforms.


<span xsmall>IBM QRadar SIEM</span>
IBM® QRadar® Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) helps security teams accurately detect and prioritize threats across the enterprise, and it provides intelligent insights that enable teams to respond quickly to reduce the impact of incidents. By consolidating log events and network flow data from thousands of devices, endpoints and applications distributed throughout your network, QRadar correlates all this different information and aggregates related events into single alerts to accelerates incident analysis and remediation.  QRadar SIEM is available on premises and in a cloud environment.

                             aleph1@underground.org

    `smash the stack` [C programming] n. On many C implementations
    it is possible to corrupt the execution stack by writing past
    the end of an array declared auto in a routine.  Code that does
    this is said to smash the stack, and can cause return from the
    routine to jump to a random address.  This can produce some of
    the most insidious data-dependent bugs known to mankind.
    Variants include trash the stack, scribble the stack, mangle
    the stack; the term mung the stack is not used, as this is
    never done intentionally. See spam; see also alias bug,
    fandango on core, memory leak, precedence lossage, overrun screw.

YARA in a nutshell                                                              rule silent_banker : banker

YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to         meta:
identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions            description = "This is just an example"
of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or              thread_level = 3
binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings             in_the_wild = true
and a boolean expression which determine its logic. Let's see an example:       
                                                                                    strings:
                                                                                        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}
                                                                                        $b = {8D 4D B0 2B C1 83 C0 27 99 6A 4E 59 F7 F9}
                                                                                        $c = "UVODFRYSIHLNWPEJXQZAKCBGMT"
                                                                                
                                                                                    condition:
                                                                                        $a or $b or $c
                                                                                }

The above rule is telling YARA that any file containing one of the three 
strings must be reported as silent_banker. This is just a simple example, 
more complex and powerful rules can be created by using wild-cards, case-
insensitive strings, regular expressions, special operators and many other 
features that you'll find explained in YARA's documentation.

multi-platform, running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and can be 
used through its command-line interface or from your own Python scripts with 
the yara-python extension.

<pre zoom>
he NSA ANT (Advanced Network Technology?) catalog is a 50-page classified 
document listing technology available to the United States National Security 
Agency (NSA) Tailored Access Operations (TAO) by the Advanced Network 
Technology (ANT) Division to aid in cyber surveillance. Most devices are 
described as already operational and available to US nationals and members of 
the Five Eyes alliance. According to Der Spiegel, which released the catalog 
to the public on December 30, 2013, "The list reads like a mail-order catalog
, one from which other NSA employees can order technologies from the ANT 
division for tapping their targets' data."[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] The 
document was created in 2008.[10]

https://www.infoq.com/news/2019/03/sap-composition-analysis
SAP has released the source code for Vulnerability Assessment Tool, a software composition analysis (SCA) tool that was tested internally for two years with 20,000 scans on more than 600 projects.

The Vulnerability Assessment Tool focuses specifically on the detection of vulnerable components as it is stated in OWASP-Top 10 2017 A9. The tool scans software packages for direct and transitive dependencies and then compares each dependency to known sources, like the National Vulnerability Database or CVE list, to determine if known vulnerabilities or exploits exist for each package. During development, this knowledge can inform developers on when they should upgrade certain components. During operations, when a new vulnerability is discovered, this information can be used to locate which applications require action.

Semmle created LGTM, a continuous code analysis platform aimed to identify vulnerabilities in software systems. At the heart of LGTM lies Semmle QL, a query language and code search engine that enables code analysis to find and eradicate security vulnerabilities.

QL uses variant analysis, a technique security engineers typically use to identify vulnerabilities starting from a known vulnerability that is treated as a seed for the search process. In other words, once a vulnerability is identified through, e.g., pen-testing or other techniques, security researchers audit the rest of the code base to find similar problems. That is the process QL automates and extend across multiple code bases allowing developers to write queries that can be shared and reused. According to Semmle, their solutions have been used to identify thousands of vulnerabilities, including over 100 CVEs in open source projects.

Small Is Beautiful: How to Improve Security by Maintaining Less Code
------------------
https://www.businessinsider.es/vive-mejor-cazador-ransomware-mundo-obligado-esconderse-630211

El mejor 'cazador de ransomware' del mundo vive aislado y rodeado de cámaras en un lugar secreto en Reino Unido por las amenazas que recibe a diario de las mafias de ciberdelincuentes

- Fabian Wosar es conocido por romper el cifrado que usan los delincuentes para apoderarse de los sistemas informáticos, conocidos como "ataques de ransomware".
El ransomware le costó al mundo al menos 7.500 millones de dólares el año pasado, según el empleador de Wosar, y podría haber devastado hospitales abrumados.
    Wosar ha suministrado a las compañías y hospitales herramientas gratuitas para combatir el ransomware que, hasta ahora, han frustrado a delincuentes con rescates estimados en 1.000 millones.
    Pero su actividad también le ha valido sufrir amenazas de muerte tan severas que, desde hace poco menos de 2 años, se vio obligado a huir de su tierra natal y vivir completamente escondido.

@[http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/seminars/2268.html]

According to the BBC, Fabian Wosar is known in the security industry as "as one of - if not the - best ransomware expert." However, such a label makes him somewhat uncomfortable. During the day he works from his home in London as the CTO of the New Zealand anti-malware company Emsisoft. But during the night his two adorable (and slightly flatulent) moggies and him create free ransomware decryption tools. The decryptors he has created over the past 7 years have been downloaded more than 1.75 million times, helping individuals and businesses recover their vital data and memories and avoid paying more than $1 billion in ransom demands in total.

applications, for personal or professional projects, to manage the 
network stack, the firewall, or to fulfill other user-defined 
purposes.

Natures : full-fledged or stripped-down virtual machines 
which are based on popular operating systems such as Fedora, Debian 
or Windows.

Levels of trust : from complete to non-existent. All 
windows are displayed in a unified desktop environment with 
unforgeable colored window borders so different security levels are 
easily identifiable.

Mozilla just announced a new security technology that will let you 
look into your server’s memory processes and it’s called Masche.

As you’d expect the code is open-source.

The tool scans memory processes, while allowing for normal unabated 
operations. Masche acts as a complement to Mozilla’s existing 
digital forensics and threat response platform Mozilla InvestiGator 
or MIG. The platform views information from thousands of hosts 
simultaneously, but cannot see into memory processes.

Masche’s technology makes up for this handicap. Mozilla says that 
while Masche provides fast memory scans, it doesn’t offer advanced 
forensic features, like Volatility or Rekall (two advanced forensics 
frameworks).

“Instead, it focuses on searching for regexes and byte strings in 
the processes of large pools of systems, and does so live and very 
fast,” Mozilla writes in a blog post.

The memory forensics library that supports the memory scans was 
designed by a group of students at the University of Buenos Aires. 
The program runs on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

This free open-source solution certainly could help coders secure 
enterprise and startup server networks in a cost-effective way.

<span xsmall> Infection Monkey</span>
@[https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/08/07/open-source-tool-infection-monkey/]
- free, open sourceºbreach and attack simulation (BAS)ºtool 
- maps to the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base and tests network adherence to the 
 ºForrester Zero Trust frameworkº.

Over the past four years, Infection Monkey has gained significant 
momentum and popularity amongst the cybersecurity community. With 
more than 3,200 stars on Github, Infection Monkey is trusted by large 
enterprises, educational institutions, and more, and has garnered 
praise from distinguished industry analysts such as Dr. Chase 
Cunningham, principal analyst at Forrester.

“In cyberspace and in cyber warfare exploitation, attacks succeed 
because they locate and leverage the weak points in systems and 
networks. In order to defend from this type of attack cycle, it is 
necessary to continually test the system for those likely weak 
points. But this can be difficult, especially when dealing with large 
infrastructures that are bridged between cloud, non-cloud, on 
premises, off premises, and a wide variety of other potential 
configurations. Infection Monkey is one of the most well-aligned 
tools that fits this need. I’m a huge fan.” – from Chase 
Cunningham’s Cyber Warfare – Trust, Tactics, and Strategies.
Expanded MITRE ATT&CK techniques and reporting

Cybersecurity experts and enterprise DevSecOps teams continue to rely 
on the MITRE-developed ATT&CK framework as the foundation for network 
security tests and assessments.

Infection Monkey 1.9.0 now offers a total of 32 MITRE ATT&CK 
techniques available for testing. These new attack techniques enable 
cybersecurity professionals to exhaustively test their network like 
never before while also empowering them to easily communicate steps 
towards actionable remediation with all relevant stakeholders, from 
IT to the C-suite.

    <span xsmall>Evaluation Assurance Level</span>
    @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_Assurance_Level]
The Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL1 through EAL7) of an IT product 
or system is a numerical grade assigned following the completion of a 
Common Criteria security evaluation, an international standard in 
effect since 1999. The increasing assurance levels reflect added 
assurance requirements that must be met to achieve Common Criteria 
certification. The intent of the higher levels is to provide higher 
confidence that the system's principal security features are reliably 
implemented. The EAL level does not measure the security of the 
system itself, it simply states at what level the system was tested.
