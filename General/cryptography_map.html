<span xsmall>Concepts</span>
- ºDoing encryption right is tough, managing secrets is even harder.º

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security">Perfect Secrecy</a>
  refers to a cryptosystem whose security derives purely from information theory.
  In other words, it cannot be broken even if the adversary had unlimited computing power.
   The adversary simply does not have enough information to break the encryption and so the
  cryptosystems are considered cryptanalytically-unbreakable.

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">(Perfect) Forward Secrecy</a>
     gives assurances your session keys will not be compromised even if the private key
     of the server is compromised. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future
     compromises of secret keys or passwords.
     WARN: Simple simetric encryption schemas are NOT forward secrecy compliant, and a
     compromised keys can reveal past encrypted-communications.

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Secret_sharing</a>
    refers to methods for distributing a secret amongst a group of participants,
    each of whom is allocated a share of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed
    only when a sufficient number, of possibly different types, of shares are combined
    together; individual shares are of no use on their own.

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">Avalanche_effect</a>:
  desirable property of cryptographic algorithms, typically block ciphers and cryptographic
  hash functions, wherein if an input is changed slightly (for example, flipping a single bit),
  the output changes significantly.


- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">Malleability</a>
  - An (often) undesirable property of some cryptographic algorithms.
  - An encryption algorithm is "malleable" if it is possible to transform a ciphertext
    into another ciphertext which decrypts to a related plaintext.

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_function">Sponge Function</a>
   In cryptography, a sponge function or sponge construction is any
   of a class of algorithms with finite internal state that take an
   input bit stream of any length and produce an output bit stream of
   any desired length. Sponge functions have both theoretical and
   practical uses. They can be used to model or implement many
   cryptographic primitives, including cryptographic hashes, message
   authentication codes, mask generation functions, stream ciphers,
   pseudo-random number generators, and authenticated encryption.[1]

<span xsmall>brute force attacks</span>
@[https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary/status/969935429712666625]
According to the second law of thermodynamics,
the minimum amount of energy required to record a single
bit by changing the state of a system is:

  K x T  (Boltzman Constant "times" the temperature of the system)

Assuming our computer is ideal and running at 3.2 K (The temperature
of the cosmic background radiation), a bit change would consume
4.4 x 10^-16 erg.
Since the annual output of the Sun is 1.21 x 10^41 Erg, if we
used all its energy we could power 2.7 x 10^56 single bit changes,
which is enough to put a 187-bit counter through all its values.

To run through a 256-bit key we would need to build Dyson spheres
and capture the energy of:

º2^69 = 5.9 x 10^20 Suns during a year!!!º

Peer 1                              Peer 2
Plain → |Encrypt|→ C1 → |Decrypt| → Plain

            └─ KEY("Secret") ┘
         Shared by peer 1 and 2
NOTE: In symmetric crypto the key is often refered with
      the name of "password" to distinguish from the "private key"
      used in asymmetric crypto. schemas.

Symmetric cyrptography broadly splits into:
ºStream cipherº:
 - inputs of "any lenght". Very difficult to implement properly
   Implementations: ChaCha, ...

     INPUT     → |Keystream |→ K0, K1, ...
   (KEY, NONCE)  |Generator |         → XOR → C0, C1, ...
                               M0, M1, ...

 - "BUTS": Generate a safe (non predictive) KEY for the stream cipher is "difficult"
ºBlock cipherº:
 - inputs must be divided into chunks of same size
 - Hide plaintext transformation to ciphertext through:
   - ºconfusionº: mapping input to output hard to predict (not linear and parts of keys)
   - ºdiffusionº: permutate bits
ºSP-Networksº:
 - Most block ciphers are based on SP-Networks composed of:
   - Subtitution box : "map˂byte, byte˃"   (replace bytes with bytes )
   - Permutation box :  moves bits around
   - Some substitution plus permutation are combined into a single round
   - Rounds are then repeated enough times to ensure the algorithm is secure
   - SP-Networks alone are not enought. KEY secret is used like:
                  ROUND1                ROUND2
   Plain → XOR → |Subsitution| → XOR → |Subsitution| → C
           KEY   |Permutation|   KEY   |Permutation|

<span xsmall>Padding</span>:
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography)]
- used when the message does exactly match a multiple of key size.
- Required by block padding cyphers. Streaming modes of operation
  can encrypt and decrypt messages of any size and therefore do

<span xsmall>Modes of operation</span>
- A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic
  transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits
  called a block. A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a
  cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger
  than a block.
- Most modes require a unique binary sequence, often called
  an initialization vector (IV), for each encryption operation. The IV has to
  be non-repeating and, for some modes, random as well. The initialization
  vector is used to ensure distinct ciphertexts are produced even when the
  same plaintext is encrypted multiple times independently with the same key.
- Block ciphers have one or more block size(s), but during transformation
  the block size is always fixed.
- Block cipher modes operate on whole blocks and require that the last part
  of the data be padded to a full block if it is smaller than the current
  block size.
- There are, however, modes that do not require padding because they
  effectively use a block cipher as a stream cipher.
- Electronic code block (ECB):
  (WARN: Don't use it, if different messages share same data information leaks cans rise)
M1 → |E_k| → C1
M2 → |E_k| → C2
M3 → |E_k| → C3
- Cipher block chaining (CBC):
IV: Initialization vector
M1 → |XOR(IV)| → |E_k| → C1
   → |XOR(M2)| → |E_k| → C2
   → |XOR(M3)| → C3
  "BUTs":
   - Not paralelizable , and can not seek randomnly
   - Needs an IV (Difficult to generate)
- Counter Mode (CT):(Can be paralellized)
  Nonce + 0 → |E_k| → XOR(M1) → C1
  Nonce + 1 → |E_k| → XOR(M2) → C2

  ºHow do I interpret the results ?º
  Let's suppose:
    - connection bandwidth: 10 Gbs (=1,250MBs)
    - Web server is able to concurrently encrypt|decrypt
      data to saturate the 10 gigabit connection.
    - Suppose 100% of our clients use AES-128-GCM cipher

  IDEALLY we would like the CPU could processes 10Gbs/1,250MBs of AES encrypted data per-cpu-core.
  - Since we need to recieve (decrypt) and send (encrypt) the data we need at least two(2) CPU cores.
    -  each CPU must be able to sustain 1,250 MB/s.
  - From previous performance-table, just "AMD Opteron 6380" and  faster ones will be able to keep to pace.
    (Note: Opteron-6380 has 16 cores, so it leaves many other CPU cores for network I/O, firewall rules, ...)

  REAL-WORLD:
    - Clients connect with a variety of ciphers and the system is not dedicated to
      just cipher processing.
    - It is also possible that the cipher processing of multiple cpu cores can be
      added together to reach the desired speed.
      - "Intel Xeon L5630" four cores that can process up to 701 MB/s AES-128-GCM data.(2,804 MBs)
      (enough speed for encrypting and decrypting data on a 10 gigabit link using AES-128-GCM)

- Extracted from @[https://www.mail-archive.com/cypherpunks@cpunks.org/msg02419.html]
  sums up the benefits of Schnorr as follows:
  "simple blinding, compact multi-sig, clearer security proofs, better security margin,
   less dependence on hash properties."

Summary of advantages versus ECDSA:
  - Simpler to securely implement
  - Composable threshold signatures without multi-party computation
  - Verification happens off-network allowing for sophisticated functionality without increasing network load or complexity
  - Conducive to highly distributed systems
  - Less constraints allows for more optimal and secure design schemes

  - DSA schemes are difficult to manage because the schemes are easy to get wrong.
    An improper implementations is trivial to break, and what might seem like a minor
    misstep can precipitate a system-wide vulnerability—as demonstrated by
    @[http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/10/25/sony-ps3-hacked-for-good-master-keys-revealed/]
    ...  Hackers were able to access full control of the PS3 employing "simple algebra" after Sony
    set a constant in its custom DSA implementation instead of a randomly generated number.
    The sensitivity of DSA signatures to human error allowed this single oversight to fully
    compromise the console's encryption protections, exposing the platform and Sony's partners
    to the perpetual threat of piracy.
  - Alternatively, Schnorr signatures are more forgiving and simpler to implement because its
    security is inherently more robust based on the scheme’s dynamic hash function
  @[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=4908440]
    The ephemeral public value r is tightly bound to the message, which means that the security
    of the scheme is no longer dependent on the collision resistance of the hash function.
  @[http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/Publications/pub_master.jsp?id=2001023]

  - Independent verification and combining:
    Another advantage of Schnorr is related to threshold signatures
  - ECDSA can create threshold signatures, but requires multi-party computation
   @[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation]
    This means that the number of participants required to generate a signature
    without revealing their secrets is twice the number of shares required to recover the key.
    - In contrast, Schnorr has no such restriction. Shares of a signature can be independently
      verified and then composed.

    was seen by a holder of the secret key at some point.
    HMAC is a signature based on a secret key, providing similar

│  a group of users that each have keys.                                    │
│  One of the security properties of a ring signature is                    │
│  that it should be computationally infeasible to determine which of       │
│  the group members' keys was used to produce the signature                │
│- Ring signatures are similar to group signatures but differ in two key    │
│  ways: first, there is no way to revoke the anonymity of an individual    │
│  signature, and second, any group of users can be used as a group without │
│  additional setup.                                                        │
│- Invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Yael Tauman, and introduced      │
│  at ASIACRYPT in 2001                                                     │
│- Suppose that a group of entities each have public/private key pairs,     │
│  (Pub_1, Secret_1), ..., (Pn, Secret_n).                                  │
│  Party i can compute a ring signature σ on a message "m", on input        │
│  ("m", Secret_i, Pub_1, ..., Pub_n). Anyone can check the                 │
│  validity of a ring signature given σ, m, and the public keys involved,   │
│  P1, ..., Pn. If a ring signature is properly computed, it should pass    │
│  the check. On the other hand, it should be hard for anyone to create a   │
│  valid ring signature on any message for any group without knowing any    │
│  of the private keys for that group.                                      │

<span xsmall bgorange>Crypto accumulator</span>
- one way non-invertible function.
- It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is
   a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set.

  Ex: large composite number CP01 = P1 x P2 x P3 x ... PN
      Does P2 "belongs" to CP01? Yes, but we still don't known P1, P3, ... PN
- New members may be added or subtracted to the set of
  factors simply by multiplying or factoring out the number respectively.

Extracted from:
@[https://medium.com/@aurelcode/cryptographic-accumulators-da3aa4561d77]
We can think of accumulators as a super-charged hash function that
works on sets. A regular hash function, like SHA-3, takes a single message and
outputs a fixed-size hash. An accumulator, however, takes a set of values and
turns them into a single number, also of constant size.

Alice secret
  → alt 1: hash secret        → publish hash  → reveal message to Bob (Bob can check)
  → alt 2: add to accumulator → publish accu  → reveal message to Bob, Bob can check,
                                                but the rest of secrets of the
                                                accumulator stay in place.

BºMerkle treeº
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree]
  - Allows to check if a leaf (data) is part of the tree with just a
    subset of the tree.
  - NOTE: In blockchain leafs are transactions and the tree is a block

  - It is deterministic and cryptographically verifiable:
    - The only way to generate a state root is by computing it from each
      individual piece of the state, and two states that are identical can
      be easily proven so by comparing the root hash and the hashes that led
      to it (a Merkle proof). 
    - Conversely, there is no way to create two different states with
      the same root hash, and any attempt to modify state with different 
      values will result in a different state root hash.

  └BºPatricia Treeº (Used by Ethereum,...)
   @[https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/12/30/eth1x-files-state-of-stateless-ethereum/]
   Fun fact: ‘Trie’ is originally taken from the word ‘retrieval’, but most
   people pronounce it as ‘try’ to distinguish it from ‘tree’ when speaking.
   "...At one end of the trie, there are all of the particular pieces of 
   data that describe state (value nodes). This could be a particular 
   account’s balance, or a variable stored in a smart contract (such 
   as the total supply of an ERC-20 token). In the middle are branch 
   nodes, which link all of the values together through hashing. A 
   branch node is an array containing the hashes of its child nodes, and 
   each branch node is subsequently hashed and put into the array of its 
   parent node. This successive hashing eventually arrives at a single 
   state root node on the other end of the trie..."

<span xsmall>Secret sharing</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing]
- provides a method of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts,
  giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all
  of them are needed in order to reconstruct the secret.
   Counting on all participants to combine the secret might be impractical, and
   therefore sometimes the threshold scheme is used where any "k" of the parts
   are sufficient to reconstruct the original secret
  The essential idea of Adi Shamir's threshold scheme is that 2 points are
   sufficient to define a line, 3 points are sufficient to define a parabola, 4
   points to define a cubic curve and so forth. That is, it takes k points to
   define a polynomial of degree k − 1

<span xsmall>Authenticated Encryption (AE)</span>
<span xsmall>AE with associated data(AEAD)</span>

<a xsmall href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption"></a>
- The need for AE emerged from the observation that securely combining
   separate confidentiality and authentication block cipher operation modes
   could be error prone and difficult confirmed by a number of practical
   attacks introduced into production protocols and applications by
   incorrect implementation, or lack, of authentication (including SSL/TLS)
- A typical programming interface for AE mode implementation would provide the following functions:

 Encryption
     Input : plaintext, key, and optionally a header in plaintext that will not
             be encrypted, but will be covered by authenticity protection.
     Output: ciphertext and authentication tag (message authentication code).
 Decryption
     Input : ciphertext, key, authentication tag, and optionally a header.
     Output: plaintext, or an error if the authentication tag does not match
             the supplied ciphertext or header.

- Approaches to authenticated encryption:
  - Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)
  - Encrypt-and-MAC (E-and-M)
  - MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE)

    - plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure.

JWTs can be signed with:
- symetric shared secrets (HMAC)
- asymetrict key pairs RSA/ECDSA.
(opt): JWTs can also be encrypted to provide secrecy between parties.

ºJWT common ussage patterns:º
- user agent should send the JWT in the HTTP Authorization header
  using the Bearer schema like:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  (ºStateless authorizationº)

 º☞ By sending in the Authorization header, Cross-Origin Resource Sharingº
 º  (CORS) won't be an issue as it doesn't use cookies.º

- A typicalºOpenID Connect compliant web applicationºwill go through the
 º/oauth/authorizeºendpoint using the authorization code flow.
  When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an
  access token back to the  application.

- no secret information must be placed into the PAYLOAD unless the JWT is
  encrypted.

- Don't store JWT inside localStorage since it's accessible by any script
  inside the page: an XSS attack can let an external attacker get access
  to the token.
- Don’t store JWT in local or session storage.
  If third-party scripts in the page  get compromised,
  they can access all your users' tokens.
- Stored JWT inside an httpOnly cookie, that’s only sent in
  HTTP requests to the server and it's never accessible
  (both for reading or writing) from JS running in the browser.

- Don't use JWT as Sessions since it's error prone.

Since JWT are signed, the receiver can be sure the client is really who it
thinks it is.

  when compared to the simplicity of signing JSON.

    """
    OpenID is about verifying a person's identity.
    OAuth is about accessing a person's stuff.
    OpenID Connect does both.
    """
OpenID Connect (2014) combines the features of OpenID 2.0, OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0, and OAuth 2.0 in a single protocol.

<span xsmall>Dex</span>
@[https://github.com/dexidp/dex]
Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect
to drive authentication for other apps.
Dex acts as a portal to other identity providers through
"connectors." This lets dex defer authentication to
LDAP servers, SAML providers, or established identity
providers like GitHub, Google, and Active Directory.

 Clients write their authentication logic once to talk
to Dex, then Dex handles the protocols for a given backend.

<span xsmall>OpenID vs OAuth2 vs SAML</span>
REF:
@[https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/05/30/openid-oauth-saml/]

- single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to enter sign once
  and "enter" multiple applications or web-sites.
  This means that some sort of "authentication token"
  must be provided to the user on first sign for later
  reuse.

- developers of the SSO applications don't have to
  store or request for passwords. Instead, they can
 ºaccept proof of identity or authorizationº
 ºfrom a trusted sourceº

- OpenID, OAuth2 and SAML are different security protocols
  for single sign-on

  the relying party.
ºOpenIDº
- open standard for authentication
- As of March 2016, there are over a billion
  OpenID-enabled accounts on the internet.
- Google, WordPress, Yahoo, PayPal use OpenId
  to authenticate users.

OpenID FLOW:
user → id_provider01: request OpenID account
user ← id_provider01: OpenID account
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                      technically it's a URL
                      (e.g. alice2016.myIDprovider.org)

user → web_site login_screen: Select "sign with id_provider01"
       (relying party)
web_site login_screen → id_provider01: request association handle
web_site login_screen ← id_provider01: association handle
user ← web_site login_screen: redirect to id_provider01 login page
user → id_provider01: enter OpenID account + credentials (pass,...)
user ← id_provider01: auth.token + url_redirect o web_site
                      ^^^^^^^^^^
                      signed claim statying that id_provider01
                      believes user is actually user
user → web_site url : auth.token
web_site url → web_site url : Check auth.token is signed by trusted
                              id_provider01
web_site url → web_site url : Create session for user
user ←→ web_site url : --- app session ---

- 2014: Latest version (OpenID Connect) combines:
  - OpenID authentication  (user is who he claims to be)
  - OAuth2 authorization   (user is authorized a set of actions)

ºOAuth2º
- Confusingly, OAuth2 is also the basis for OpenID Connect -2014-)
- Confusingly, authorization is also considered some time a form
 of pseudo-authentication and OAuth2 is claimed to be an
 authentication standard. (An authorization signed token is a
 claim that the user is believed to be himself for the act of
 executing an action or accesing some resource).

- open standard for authorization.
- OAuth2 provides secure delegated access:
  - application clients will use temporal tokens issued by
    the identity-provider to the user to access resources
    on another resource-server on behalf of the user.

ºSAMLº
- 2001: oldest standard of the three
- 2005: latest update.
- stands for Security Assertion Markup Language.
- provides authentication + authorization.
- SAML defines:
  - principal (end user).
  - service provider (application web site)
  - identity provider:  server holding principal's ids + credentials.

                               (similar to a token in OpenID/OAuth2).
                                The assertion can contain statements
                                about authentication, authorization,
                                and/or attributes (emails, phones,...).

SAML 2.0 defines:
- assertions:
- protocols : assertion requests and responses)
- bindings  : how requests/responses happen between the service provider and identity provider
              using communication methods like HTTP POST
- profile   : allowed combinations of (assertions, protocols, bindings)
              for various use cases, like SSO.

│                                   (vs BER-Basic, CER - Canonical)
│- X.509 PEM ENCODING: Base64-ASCII encoding for X.509v3 certificates, 
│                                   prefixed with a "—– BEGIN ..." line
│                     ºPEMºis an acronym forº(P)rivacy (E)nhanced (M)ailº
│
│- NOTE common X.509 file extensions include:
│  - .CRT: certificates encoded as binary der or as ascii pem.
│  - .CER: certificates . Mostly similar to .CRT, recognized
│          by some Microsoft products (IE, MS cryptoAPI commands, ...)
│  - .KEY: used for private PKCS#8 keys (and its corresponding public key)
│          encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM.
│
│- PKCS#7  Standard: Cryptographic Message Syntax used to sign and/or encrypt messages under PKI
│                    - ASCII files, also known as P7B,
│                      which can contain (non-secret) certificates
│                      and CA certificates.
│
│- PKCS#12 Standard: file format commonly used for (private)keystores, protected with a password-based
│                    symmetric key. Used by:
│                    - Java key store

<span xsmall>Certs Transparency</span>
@[https://www.certificate-transparency.org/]
(See also <a href="?query=Trillian">Trillian</a>
- G.C.T. project fixes several structural flaws in the SSL certificate system
matching- open framework for monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in nearly real time.
  detecting SSL certificates that have been mistakenly issued by a certificate authority
  or maliciously acquired from an otherwise unimpeachable certificate authority.
  It also makes it possible to identify certificate authorities that have gone rogue
rl.pem*  and are maliciously issuing certificates.
-ºCertificate LOGSº:simple network services that maintain cryptographically
assured, publicly auditable, append-only records of certificates. Anyone can
submit certificates to a log, although certificate authorities will likely be
the foremost submitters
-ºMonitorsº are publicly run servers that periodically contact all of the log
servers and watch for suspicious certificates. For example, monitors can tell
if an illegitimate or unauthorized certificate has been issued for a domain,
and they can watch for certificates that have unusual certificate extensions
or strange permissions, such as certificates that have CA capabilities.

-ºAuditorsº: lightweight components performing two functions:
- verify that logs are behaving correctly and are cryptographically
consistent. If a log is not behaving properly, then the log will need to explain
itself or risk being shut down.
- verify that a particular certificate appears in a log. This is a particularly
important auditing function because the Certificate Transparency framework
requires that all SSL certificates be registered in a log. If a certificate has
not been registered in a log, it’s a sign that the certificate is suspect, and
TLS clients may refuse to connect to sites that have suspect certificates.

@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol]

- Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate.
- Alternative to Certificate Revocation Lists to addressg problems associated with
  using CRLs in a public key infrastructure (PKI).
- Messages are encoded in ASN.1

- Architecture is "request/response" message based.
- Supported by different web browsers

ºComparison to CRLsº
- OCSP response contains less data than a typical CRL file
- easier to parse by end client-side libraries
- OCSP discloses to the responder that """a particular
  network host used a particular certificate at a particular time"""

ºBasic PKI implementationº
participant: Alice  with certificate issued by CA Carol
participant: Bob    with certificate issued by CA Carol
Carol      : CA

Alice wishes to perform a transaction with Bob.
Alice → Bob: Alice pub.key Certificate
Bob   → Bob:(concerned that Alice's priv.key is compromised)
             creates an 'OCSP-request'
                        --------------
                        Alice_cert.serial_number

Carol → Carol: reads certificate serial number.

Carol → Bob  : Signed OCSP-response with
               'good'|'revoked'|'unknown'|'error code'
               key signing OCSP-response must be the
               original key signing the cert. originally
               or another cert. issued by the original CA
               that is marked with a certain extension to
               flag it as OCSP signing authority.

Bob   → Alice: ...

ºProtocol detailsº
- OCSP request format supports additional extensions.
- OCSP can be vulnerable to replay attacks,[5] where a signed,
  'good' response is captured by a malicious intermediary and
  replayed to the client at a later date after the subject
  certificate may have been revoked.  A nonce can be included
  to avoid it.
  - Because of high load, most OCSP responders do not use the
    nonce extension to create a different response for each
    request, instead using presigned responses with a validity
    period of multiple days.
   ºThus, the replay attack is a major threat to validation systemsº

- OCSP can support more than one level of CA chaining/forwarding
  initial OCSP-requests to by delegated path validation (DPV) servers.

(See Criticisms in original wikipedia article)

Supported by
Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox 3+, Safari-macOS.
RºGoogle Chrome disabled OCSP checks by default in 2012º

Rºown update mechanism to retrieved revoked certificatesº

- An XML signature used to sign a resource outside its containing

- if it contains the signed data within itself it is called an
  enveloping signature.

- Don't Implement your own algorithms
- Don't Use hard-coded keys, use a Vault service.
  Don't use a Vault when you can use wallet. (that will use an
  internal vault and never expose secrets outside)
- Never use ECB mode. Prefer CBC, better yet CTR or
  GCM@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode]
  - RºWARN: ECB is the default mode in JAVAº.

<span xsmall>Kerberos protocol</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)]
@[https://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/]
- computer-network protocol designed to
 ºprovide strong client/server mutual authenticationº

- ºbuilt on symmetric key cryptographyº and
  ºmay (optionally) use public-key cryptographyº
  ºduring certain phases of authenticationº
- ºrequires a trusted third partyº
- ºworks on the basis of ticketsº
- allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network
  to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner,
  protecting against eavesdropping and replay attacks.

ºHistory and developmentº
- 19?? MIT 1st Kerberos version
  based on the earlier Needham–Schroeder symmetric key protocol.
- Versions 1-3 were only MIT internals.

- Late 1980s: version 4 (by Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman)

- 1993: Version 5, becomes also RFC 1510

- 2000: Default authentication method in Windows 2000
        - RFC 3244 documents Microsoft additions to the standard
          suite of protocols:
        "Microsoft Windows 2000 Ker. Change and Set Password Proto."
        RFC 4757 documents Microsoft's use of the RC4 cipher.
        Kerberos is used as preferred authentication method:
       ºIn general, joining a client to a Windows domain means   º
       ºenabling Kerberos as default protocol for authenticationsº
       ºfrom that client to services in the Windows domain and   º
       ºall domains with trust relationships to that domain.     º
       (fallback to NTLM ifeither client or server are not joined to a domain*


- 2005: RFC 4120 makes (1993) RFC 1510 obsolet. Updates by IETF included:
  - Encryption and Checksum Specifications (RFC 3961)
  - AES (RFC 3962)
  - new edition of the Kerberos V5 spec
    "The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)" (RFC 4120).
  - new edition of
    "The Kerberos V5 Generic Security Service API (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2." (RFC 4121).

- 2???: MIT implementation freely available (BSD license)

- 2007: MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium to foster continued development.
        Founding sponsors include Oracle, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Centrify Corporation, TeamF1,
        Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, Stanford University, MIT, CyberSafe.

ºDrawbacks and limitationsº
- Kerberos requires user accounts, user clients
  and the services on the server to all have a
  trusted relationship to the Kerberos token server
  All must be in the same Kerberos domain or in domains
  that have a trust relationship between each other.
  - creating staged environments (e.g. separate domains for
    test, pre-production, production) is difficult.


ºKerberos delegationº
- Kerberos delegation is used in multi-tier application/service situations:
-  A common scenario would be a web server application making calls to
   a database running on another server.
   -  The first tier is the user who browses to the web site’s URL.
   -  The second tier is the web site.
   -  The third or data tier would be the database.
  ºDelegation allows the database to know who is actually accessing its dataº

  Non-Kerberos Security Setup:
    webserver_admin → database1_admin : request database  access for "WebServerAcct"
    database1_admin → database1_admin : grant "sufficient" access to "Database1Acct"
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    webapp developers and/or admins determine who can access the web application
    and by extension the data in the back end.
    Rº(it may be unacceptable to the database admins as they cannot control whoº
    Rº ultimately has access to the data)                                      º

  Kerberos delegation Setup:
    - grant "WebServerAcct" permission to delegate to the "Database1Acct".
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      When a user accesses the web site they authenticate with Windows Integrated Authentication:
      user → webserver: request + user-kerberos-ticket1
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                  contains a list of the user's
                                  AD group memberships.

      webserver → webserver: check that user-kerberos-ticket1 is in Database group
      webserver → AD controller: (delegation configure)
                                 request a Kerberos ticket to the database
                                 impersonating the user rather than "WebServerAcct"
      ...
      webserver → Database1: request + user-kerberos-ticket2
      Database1 → Database1: check that user-kerberos-ticket1 is allowed

<span xsmall>LDAP</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol]

- application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed
  directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

- Directory services roles:
  - share information about users and services throughout the network,
    like mails, phones, user/passwords, ...

ºHistoryº
- 1980s: Telco companies develop the concept of directory services
         culminating in the comprehensive X.500 specification
         by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the 1980s.

- 1993 : First version created as a subset of X.500 for TCP/IP
         While the X.500 was "heavy" in network bandwith, LDAP was
         "light", better suited for TCP/IP at that time.

- 1997: LDAPv3
        - added support for extensibility
        - integrates Simple Authentication and Security Layer

- 2006: Latest version (RFC 4511)
        road map to the technical specifications is provided by [RFC4510]
        - The Protocol [RFC4511]
        - Directory Information Models [RFC4512]
        - Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms [RFC4513]
        - Uniform Resource Locator [RFC4516]

 operation can be:
 - StartTLS    :
 - Bind        : authenticate and specify LDAP protocol version
 - Search      : search for and/or retrieve directory entries
 - Compare     : test if a named entry contains a given attribute value
 - Add    entry:
 - Delete entry:
 - Modify entry:
 - Modify DN   : move/rename an (D)istinguished (N)ame
 - Abandon     : abort a previous request
 - Extended Op : generic operation used to define other operations
 - Unbind      : close the connection (not the inverse of Bind)

- A server holds:
  - a subtree starting from a specific entry*
    For example: "dc=example,dc=com"
  - (optional) references to other servers
    an attempt to access a dn in other server will
    return a server-referral to the client.
    - (optional) some servers support chaining:
      - The server will directly contact the other
        servers on behalf of the client

When LDAP servers are in a replicated topology, LDAP clients should consider using the post-read control to verify updates instead of a search after an update.

ºURI schemeº

                  Used as search base    comma-separated  search

                                                        - sub (tree)

ºDirectory Schemaº
- set of rules (definitions and constraints) concerning
  the structure of the directory information tree (DIT),
  or what information the server can hold.
  - Attribute Syntaxes: Provide info about the kind of info that can be stored in an attribute.
  - Matching Rules    : Provide information about how to make comparisons against attribute values.
  - Matching Rule Uses: Indicate which attribute types may be used in conjunction
                        with a particular matching rule.
  - Attribute Types   : Define an object identifier (OID) and a set of names that may be
                        used to refer to a given attribute, and associates that attribute with a
                        syntax and set of matching rules.
  - Object Classes    : Define named collections of attributes and classify them into sets of
                        required and optional attributes.
                        ObjectClasses can be inherited.
  - Name Forms        : Define rules for the set of attributes that should be included in the
                        RDN for an entry.
  - Content Rules     : Define additional constraints about the object classes and attributes
                        that may be used in conjunction with an entry.
  - Structure Rule    : Define rules that govern the kinds of subordinate entries that a given
                        entry may have.

BºNOTEº: Clients may learn about the schema elements that the server supports
         by retrieving an appropriate subschema subentry.

- A schema for representing individual people within organizations is termed a white pages schema.

ºAccess control is not standardizedº  though there are commonly used models.

ºLDAP extension pointº
  - define new operations.
  - modify requests/responses (sort results,...)
  - New search scopes and Bind methods can be defined.
  - new attributes options modifying their semantics.
  - ...

ºAccess protocolº
- As LDAP has gained momentum, vendors have provided it
  ºas an access protocol to other servicesº
  For example, Unix user and group information (via PAM, NSS modules)
- LDAP is often used by other services for authentication.

ºUsageº
- two common styles of naming:
  - top level objects are the c= (country) object
    Ex:
                    l=Locality, ou=Some Organizational Unit, o=Some Organization,        c=FR
    cn=Common Name, l=Locality, ou=Some Organizational Unit, o=Some Organization, st=CA, c=US

  - top level objects are domains
    Ex:
    cn=Common Name, dc=example,  dc=com

<span xsmall TODO>Active Directory</span>
Active Directory LDAP requires that names of directory objects be
formed according to RFC 1779 and RFC 2247:
- @[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt]
    This document defines an algorithm by which a name registered with
    the Internet DNS can be represented as an LDAP distinguished name.

    subdomain.com  ←→  dc=subdomain,dc=com

    The algorithm for transforming a domain name is to begin with an
    empty distinguished name (DN) and then attach Relative Distinguished
    Names (RDNs) for each component of the domain, most significant (e.g.
    rightmost) first. Each of these RDNs is a single AttributeTypeAndValue,
    where ºthe type is the attribute "DC"º and
          ºthe value is an IA5 string containing the domain name componentº

    Two LDAP object classes are also defined.
    - dcObject: to integrate into alreaded existing schemas,
                alowing the dc attribute to be present in an entry.
    -   domain: structural object class used for entries in which no
                other information is being stored

- @[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1779.txt]
    X.500/LDAP distinguished names (primary keys) are encoded in ASN.1.
    there is a need to have a user-oriented string representation of DNs.

- protocol for securing/authentication/encrypting instant messaging communication amongst people.
 Encrypts messages, prevents eavesdroppers, authenticates peers to each other.
 It also provides OTR provides forward secrecy and malleable encryption.

- OTR uses a combination of AES 128bits sym-key algorithm,  1536-bits group-size Diffie–Hellman
  and the SHA-1 hash function.
- The primary motivation behind the protocol was providing deniable
  authentication for the conversation participants while keeping
  conversations confidential, like a private conversation in real life, or
  off the record in journalism sourcing. This is in contrast with
  cryptography tools that produce output which can be later used as a
  verifiable record of the communication event and the identities of the
  participants. The initial introductory paper was named "Off-the-Record
  Communication, or, Why Not To Use PGP".[1]
- The OTR protocol was designed by cryptographers Ian Goldberg and Nikita
  Borisov and released on 26 October 2004.[2] They provide a client library
  to facilitate support for instant messaging client developers who want to
  implement the protocol. A Pidgin and Kopete plugin exists that allows OTR
  to be used over any IM protocol supported by Pidgin or Kopete, offering an
  auto-detection feature that starts the OTR session with the buddies that
  have it enabled, without interfering with regular, unencrypted

DMARC is a protocol that helps protect the integrity and

is a combination of several components, including the Sender Policy
Framework (SPF) and Domain Keys Identified Email (DKIM), to help
verify email authenticity. There are also different levels of DMARC
policies. The "p=none" policy enables organizations to monitor
their email systems for senders, while the "p=reject" policy will
block non-compliant messages completely. BOD 18-01 mandates the use
of the p=reject policy by Oct.16.

OASIS Digital Signature Services (DSS)
@[https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=46992515]
DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an ºopen-source software libraryº
for ºelectronic signature creation and validationº. DSS supports the creation and
verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with
European legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation
and related standards closely.

DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that
signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and
standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in
a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as
a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it.
Demos are also available to assist the use of DSS as a reference implementation.

The library, ºrealised in Javaº, is open-source, available to all Member States
, businesses and citizens for re-use in electronic signature solutions. It is
continuously updated and maintained to anticipate and follow developments in
regulations and standards.

Anyone can integrate it and redistribute it under the terms of the Lesser
General Public License (LGPL 2.1).

In accordance with ETSI standards, DSS supports various document and
signature formats including PAdES, XAdES, CAdES and ASiC and is compliant
with Implementing Decision 2015/1506/EU. A “cook-book” is also provided with
documentation targeting implementers/developers and aiming at facilitating
the integration and use of DSS in their applications.

<span xsmall>Wallet vs Vault</span>
In Vaults, secrets are kept safe until needed by an application.

In wallets, the secrets (ideally) are never exposed outside the wallet.
Unsigned transactions come in, then signed transactions come out.
The wallet usually have aditional utility functions like "address agenda",
"browser of transactions", ...

A wallet makes use of a vault. (A vault is a "layer down the stack")

Vaults are generic for any type of app.

Wallets are mostly used for blockchain-like applications.

<span xsmall>Wallet vs Smart-Cards</span>
  - Some types of Smart-Cards can be considered a type of wallet, in
  the sense that they can be used to sign content using a hardware
  protected private-key.
  - Still Smart-Cards are mostly designed with Authentication as
    primary use-case, to provide that the user accessing a website,
    a bank terminal, ... is the real authorized user.
  - Wallets is mostly a blockchain concept, while smart-card is
    a general device that can be used for many purposes
    (Web TLS or SSH Client Authentication, PGP signature, ...)
  - Wallets are designed with TX signature in mind.
    A wallet protects the private key, signs the TXs and probably
    has a display that shows what's going to be signed and a
    physical button that the user must "click" in order to confirm
    the transaction.
  - Stealing of the wallet can mean stealing of the money.
  - Stealing of the smart-card means money can be stealed until
    the smart-card is cancelled.

A deterministic wallet is a system of deriving keys from
a single starting point known as a seed. The seed allows
a user to easily back up and restore a wallet without
needing any other information and can in some cases allow
the creation of public addresses without the knowledge of
the private key. Seeds are typically serialized into
human -readable words in a Mnemonic phrase.

Lattice 1:
  generalized "remote ("WiFi",...) signer" for
  cryptocurrencies, digital identity, and more.
  (The priv.key is never transmited outside the hardware,
   unsigned docs come in and signed docs come out)

ºREMOTE SIGNINGº                                     | ºSEPARATING THE SIGNER:º
wallet application technical components:             | STEP 1:
ºUSER INTERFACEº: It interfaces with both            | - let's consider moving TX signer to cloud machine.
  - persisted user data: addresses, TX history,...   |   =˃ you have to store your private key on the cloud
  - network nodes: allow to display account info     | STEP 2:
ºTX BUILDERº    : Applies the network protocol       | -Move TX builder in the cloud too
  to convert parameters (amount, recipient address   |
  , ...) into one or more hashes that make up a TX.  | """In Lattice1 we have separated the protocol and
   Note: in Ethereum, each TX is represented by a    | cryptographic functionality away from the application
     single hash, whereas in Bitcoin each consumed   | layer ... Of course keys are in a secure chip within
     input has its own hash to sign,  there can be   | the Lattice1."""
     one or many inputs per Bitcoin transaction.
ºTX SIGNERº     : sign TX hashes with private key.


ºSECURING COMPONENTS AND SEPARATING CONCERNSº
- The Lattice1 introduces a more usable, robust, and
  secure connection between application ("wallet GUI")
  and TX builder/signer components.

""app wants to pair with a user’s Lattice1 device.""

ºSTEP 1º: Find device by serial number
- find the user's agent based on a serial number.
  (not needed if Lattice1 can connect with the app
   on a local area network).

ºSTEP 2º: Transfer a Secret Code (Out of Band)
Once the app can talk (insecurely) to the Lattice1,
- app generates secret code, signs hash with that code
  using a secp256k1 private key (is different to the EC25519
  used for encryption/decription)
- User presses "Pair" button:
- Appt sends a message to Lattice1 device ºrequesting pairingº start
- Lattice1 displays a place for the user to enter
  the same code that is displayed on the application.

- With correct code lattice1 can recover secp256k1 public key
  used to sign the hash and stores both that and the curve25519
  public key, which is also sent in the payload.

ºSTEP 3º: Establish a Read-Only Permission
(Pairing is done at this point)
- Lattice1 gives app permission to view addresses,
  request signatures (that must be authorized on device screen)
  for one-off (vs automated) signatures,...

ºFINAL STATE OF A PAIRINGº

APP:                     LATTICE1 Dev:
32-byte priv.key

Pairing registry:
- app1.pub_secp256k1 (used to  check future request signatures)
- app1.pub_EC25519   (sed to decrypt future request payloads  )

(App has now established a secure connection)

some complex details avoided (using 1-time keys for future requests,
  separate pairing code generated by the Lattice1).

ºREMOTE SIGNINGº
Now app can be used as a generalized TX Signer, just like any other hardware wallet. Unlike other
hardware wallets, however, the paired application is capable of communicating with the device
wirelessly.

We are now able to request a signature on some piece of data, which is of course parameterized
and built in the CHip 1 (TX  Builder)

ºMANUAL REMOTE SIGNINGº
As mentioned above, the pairing process also creates a minimal "permission". The application may request a
signature using this permission in a way similar to existing hardware wallet TXs:

- the Lattice1 device displays transactional data to the user
  and must wait for the user to hit “accept” on the touch
  screen.

However, there are a few technical differences that are worth noting:

- data must conform to a pre-defined "schema".
 (periodically released as use cases emerge, like
  ETH transfers and BTC transactions (P2SH|P2PKH)

AUTOMATIC REMOTE SIGNING: (Ex. ecurring payments, keep-alive messages)
- Use of "recurring permissions", which require a pre-defined schema
 (just like manual signatures) in addition to a set of "rules" on the
 data that will be signed in the future. Such a permission might look like this:

{
  schemaIndex: 0,     ← published "schema" for Eth TX (0)
  typeIndex: 0,       ← ETh TX type.  0: standard TX (empty data)
  rules: [
    null    , null                                        , null,
    null    , null                                        , null,
    null    , null                                        , null,
    'equals', '0x39765400baa16dbcd1d7b473bac4d55dd5a7cffb', null,  ←  recipient
    'equals', 1000                                        , null,  ←  wei ammount
    'equals', ''                                          , null,
       ^                        ^                            ^
    typeOfRule             value1                           value2
  ],
  timeLimit: 10000                                                ← seconds elapsed between requests
}

specific rules [ nonce, gas, gasPrice, to, value, data ]

. In this case, the requester can only send a request once every 10,000 seconds. One second (or more) too early and the request will be denied.
Application SDK

All of the previously discussed functionality is made possible through a Grid
+ Software Development Kit (SDK); this SDK will be released as an open source
node.js module. We hope that developers wanting to build applications with a
separated, internet-connected, secure signing service will experiment with
the SDK and integrate with the Lattice1 device. Although Grid+ is building a
mobile wallet application, this too will be open sourced as an example of how
to leverage the Grid+ SDK.

Although the API is not finalized yet, the below Javascript snippet is an
example of what using the SDK may look like:

const Sdk = require('gridplus-sdk');
const sdk = new Sdk({ btcNode: 'localhost:48332', ethNode: 'localhost:8545' });


const req = {
  type: 'eth-transfer',
  rules: {
    value: { 'equals': 1000 },
    to: { 'equals': '0x39765400baa16dbcd1d7b473bac4d55dd5a7cffb' }
  },
  interval: 10000
}

sdk.createAutomaticPermission(req, (err, res) =˃ {
  ... do stuff ...
})

Keeping it General

Although this article mostly discusses the Lattice1 remote signing
functionality in the context of cryptocurrency transfers, it is important to
highlight that using an abstracted “signer” allows applications to request
signatures on any data that is parametrizable. One can imagine, for example,
a data schema that represents parameters of a legal contract:

RºWARN: SGX was vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre hardware bugsº
CPU instruction set allowing user-level code to allocate
private regions of memory (enclaves) protected from
processes running at higher privilege levels. (secure
remote computation, secure web browsing, DRM).

SGX is a set of instruction set extensions for CPUs
released in Fall 2015 and available on recent CPUs. The
key ability SGX provides is the notion of confidential,
private execution with integrity guarantees. In essence,
the chip has a special construct called an enclave. An
enclave is like an ordinary program, except that the
memory contents of an enclave are encrypted whenever they
are off-chip, and accessible only on-chip, and only while
the special enclave code is running. Further, the
decryption keys are available solely to code with a
certain hash: if you or a hacker were to hack the enclave
code and change its hash, that hacked code will no longer
have access to the encryption keys, repelling attacks. As
a result, this ingenious technology does not permit anyone
, even the owner of the machine who can modify the code
arbitrarily, to peek at the contents of the enclave or to
modify execution within an enclave. Further, the SGX
hardware enables remote attestation, that is, the ability
to prove to a remote computer that a given enclave is
running a particular software distribution. In essence,
the chip is able to issue a statement that says "I
guarantee to any remote party that I am running this code
with this particular hash," which is a critical
bootstrapping mechanism. Teechan is built on these two
underlying features, which, together, provide a trusted
execution environment (TEE).

Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used
for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the
authentication of domain names.  Thus, certification authorities
(CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a
certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the
certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a
collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol
that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of
verification and certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides
facilities for other certificate management functions, such as
certificate revocation.

<span xsmall>Keybase ("GPG++")</span>
@[https://julien.ponge.org/blog/simpler-gnupg-with-another-look-at-keybase/]
 Keybase essentially introduced a modern way to build trust networks, because
people can check that user123 on Keybase is also user123_coder on GitHub,
user123 on Twitter, and that the user owns the iamuser123.org domain. One can
do so by posting Keybase-signed messages to these social networks and places.
This is a good idea, because from social networks and Keybase accounts linked
to those social networks, you can build a trust network on Keybase.

Keybase provides a simplified workflow for common tasks including key
management (e.g., fetching keys of your contacts), and it has GnuPG
interoperability. You may even make the devilish (read: convenient) choice of
having your keys stored on Keybase, or just attach existing GnuPG keys that you
will still manage locally.

https://www.sslsupportdesk.com/portecle-advanced-keystore-creation-and-manipulation-tool/
Portecle is a user friendly GUI application for creating, managing and
examining keystores, keys, certificates, certificate requests, certificate
revocation lists and more.

The scenario for using such a tool is if a server system lacks the capability
of generating a CSR keypair on its own. Another Senario would be if large
networks of multiple server types, data centers and such are faced with a CSR
keypair on one system environment and the tireless key store conversions that
are required to import a keypair into a different server environment, which can
be very time consuming and frustrating.

Portecle eliminates the need for a server to create a CSR keypair. It acts as
keypair CSR generator where you can generate a single key pair, create a CSR,
import a Signing SSL certificate, convert and save different format types of
this key pair, and migrate them into the various systems required.

Portecle can be used to, for example:
- Create, load, save, and convert keystores.
- Generate DSA and RSA key pair entries with self-signed X.509 certificates.
- Import X.509 certificate files as trusted certificates.
- Import key pairs from PKCS #12.
- Clone and change the password of key pair entries and keystores.
- View the details of certificates contained within keystore entries,
  certificate files, and SSL/TLS connections.
- Export keystore entries in a variety of formats.
- Generate and view certification requests (CSRs).
- Import Certificate Authority (CA) replies.
- Change the password of key pair entries and keystores.
- Delete, clone, and rename keystore entries.
- View the details of certificate revocation list (CRL) files.

Improving trusted code delivery to the browser

There are a number of ways to improve the security of 
application-layer encryption in the browser. The first line of 
defense is to use good, trusted code. Modern application development 
is much faster because we reuse a lot of code we find on the web, but 
if any of the code that runs in the user’s browser is malicious or 
vulnerable, it undermines the encryption significantly.

Protecting the server that delivers the code is also vital. Use the 
principle of least privilege when assigning access control rights on 
that server. Use multi-party control for administration and code 
deployment. This will significantly reduce the risk of insider 
attacks.

There are also under-used code-delivery settings that instruct the 
browser to take extra precautions. These aren’t the default because 
they somewhat reduce the flexibility of the development and 
integration process, but the security they provide is worth the work, 
whether your application does encryption or not:

    HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Instructs the browser to 
always load this page over HTTPS. This prevents downgrade attacks, 
for instance, if the attacker can redirect your DNS to a malicious 
service they can’t downgrade the connection to unencrypted HTTP.
    Strict Content Security Policies (CSP): Whitelist safe sources 
for loading code. In the complex world of modern JavaScript, this 
prevents the application from dynamically loading code from a remote 
resource that you don’t know about.
    Subresource Integrity (SRI): Only load scripts that you know you 
can trust. This uses cryptographic hashes to mark trusted scripts. If 
an attacker modifies the JavaScript for an encryption application, 
this will change the hash and the code won’t load.

In addition, there is a relatively new browser API that helps with 
efficient and secure delivery of cryptographic primitives. The 
WebCrypto API provides low-level ciphers, hashes, and other 
encryption components. This helps because you don’t have to include 
those ciphers in your JavaScript. The browser implements them 
directly and can take advantage of local native execution and even 
hardware acceleration. It doesn’t prevent certain attacks, like 
just sending an unencrypted copy of the data to the bad guys, but 
WebCrypto does make browser-based encryption more standard and 
accessible.

JaDES vs EADES:
Why do we want to support AdES formats using x509 certificates? JAdES 
may be the only one worth considering if it can be used e.g. in a VC 
proof and under certain conditions... I'd even argue that JAdES could 
be just the adoption of a VC with a well defined proof format, but 
I'm not sure this is the plan of ETSI ESI TC.

I put this here as it was in Jesus' proposal. We never discussed in 
detail, what we'd support. + this doc is not very up to date.

I agree with Oscar BURGOS in that the only one worth considering is 
JAdES, and even so I do not think that EBSI should do anything. They 
were put in the document as a reminder, because AdES formats are the 
ones widely legally accepted for business transactions, eg. 
eInvoincing. But as Oscar says, ideally (using the axample of a 
eInvoice), the eInvoice could be represented as a VC.
However, I would like to check that we are not doing something 
"incompatible" or that makes somewhat difficult that representation 
(I have no idea of what can it be, just it may be woth checking).
The JAdES standard is ongoing work in ETSI 
(https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID
=52897), and they want to publish in March this year.
Anyway, I will try to talk with Juan Carlos Cruellas, who is the 
person more active driving the drafts, just to see if they are aware 
and check.

Broadly classifiable within the same arena as secure multi-party 
computation, Homomorphic Encryption is an approach to secure 
computation that does not require decrypting your data in order to 
process them. Instead, homomorphic encryption enables processing 
ciphertexts with the guarantee that encrypted results match those 
that would be produced by first decrypting input data, processing 
them, and finally encrypting them.

IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit is based on HELib, an open 
source HE library providing a number of low-level routines such set, 
add, multiply, shift, and others, along with higher-level features 
for automatic noise management, multi-threading, and so on.

Homomorphic encryption is still a rather young field which attracts 
lots of research efforts.
- Microsoft, for instance, released SEAL (Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library)

Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables 
implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and 
hopefully increase security in the process. The library is an opt-in 
repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place 
and use crypto. Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are 
cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to 
cryptographic code.

<span xsmall>Project Everest</span>
@[https://project-everest.github.io/]

A combination of several sub-projects:
- F*, a verification language for effectful programs
- miTLS, reference implementation of the TLS protocol in F*
- KreMLin, a compiler from a subset of F* to C
- HACL*, a verified library of cryptographic primitives written in F*
- Vale, a domain-specific language for verified cryptographic 
primitives in assembly
- EverCrypt, a verified crypto provider that combines HACL* and Vale 
  via an agile, multi-platform, self-configuring cryptographic API.
- EverParse, a library and tool to automatically generate verified 
  parsers and serializers for binary data formats

- introduced in @[https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/572]
- Using F* (@[https://www.fstar-lang.org/])formally probed language
  for implementation of cryptographic primitives (otherwise 
  extremely difficult and error prone to implement in C/Rust/...).
- formally-verified Curve25519, ChaCha20, Poly1305,
  P256 elliptic curve for ECDSA and ECDH, GCM, P384/P521 elliptic
  curves, ECDSA signature scheme,...
