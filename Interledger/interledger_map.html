<span xsmall>ILP Timeline Evolution</span>
- <a href="https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/266">REF:</a>
- Interledger as a SETTLEMENT System (ORIGINAL VIEW)
  - ILP cryptography support on settlement ledgers.
  - Ledgers will have support for conditional transfers and are fast enough.
  - Trust-lines are an unusual type of ledger.

- Interledger as a CLEARING System. ILPv4 (CURRENT VIEW September 2017+)
  - connectors as central actors acting as "clearing houses"
  - NORMAL CASE: connectors have some credit/trustlines relationship with each other. ILP payments go through them
  - UNUSUAL CASE:  You send every transfer through some ledger
  - ILP: try to standardize the clearing protocol
    entitities needed by connectors to clear payments: [transfers, fulfillments, rejections, quotes, route broadcasts]
    º"""settle is completely divorced from clearing payments""".º
  - 
  - Individual payments are almost always broken up into multiple smaller packets

-The Internet ºWITHº VALUE (FUTURISTIC VIEW)
 - LAYER 0: ability to send paid paquests(requests), and conditionally paid paquets(requests)
 - LAYER 1: ILP Address namespace to route packets
 - LAYER 2: Data on top of ILP. Ability to send/receive paid data by just connecting to the ILP network.
     (Stream services, PaaS, ....)
 - <span cite> (Evan Schwartz)"""...An argument here is that the reason IPv6 didn't really take off
  was because it offered relatively minor improvements over IPv4. In contrast, ILP introduces the ability
  to send value as well as information and the ILP Addresses are much more flexible even than IPv6 addresses."""</span>

<span xsmall>RFC-0015 ILP Address</span>
@[https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0015-ilp-addresses/0015-ilp-addresses.md]
- Every ledger or blockchain account is asigned a "mostly unique"<code>ILP Address</code>.
    Since there is no central authority goberning ILP address asignation collision between ILP addresses is
    possible but that collision will be detected soon since payments are also protected by sha256 hashes.
    (An ILP payment arriving to wrong recipients will not match the pre-acorded sha256 hash)

- ILP addresses provide a mechanism to route payments to their intended destination through a 
    recursive series of ILP network nodes
- Destination Addresses are complete addresses that can receive payments, always mapping to
    one account in a ledger
- Addresses Prefixes are INcomplete addresses representing a group of destination addresses,
    or a connector node 
- See @[https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0015-ilp-addresses/0015-ilp-addresses.md]
    for more info about different type of addresses, allocation schemes, requirements and REGEX

ºTrust-lines / Payment Channelsº
- Trust-line: Virtual ledger established amongst peers that keeps a
  temporal balance that periodically gets sincronised with the (real)
  settlement ledger
  Trus-lines can be divided into:
  - asymmetrical trustline: ledger with two account holders,
    and one of them is also the ledger administrator.
  -  symmetrical trustline: ledger with two account holders,
    who collaborate on an equal basis to administer the 
    ledger between them.

- Payment-channel: A trust-line with the support of 
  a blockchain or cryptographic system to secure/enhance
  payments.
  Lightning and <a href="https://ripple.com/build/payment-channels-tutorial/">
  Ripple XPR Channels</a> are two well known examples.
  More info and theory about them can also be found in the
  <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels">Bitcoin wiki</a>

- RFC-PR: Payment pointers</a>
@[https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/e949d28c19936e379e8fb5e6579b070ac66c018a/0000-payment-pointers/0000-payment-pointers.md]
and 
- P.R.:
@[https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/e949d28c19936e379e8fb5e6579b070ac66c018a/0000-payment-pointers//0000-payment-pointers.md]
  - standardized identifier for accounts that can ºRECEIVEº payments.
  - A payment pointer can be resolved to an "https" URL that provides
     the location of a payment setup service endpoint
     (previous step to payment)
  - (design goal): It's used for (pre)payment setup protocols BUT 
      it should be possible for any new payment setup protocol to "reuse"
      payment pointers.
  - The syntax of a payment pointer is (ABNF):
      "$" host path-abempty
    The corresponding URL will be
      "$" host path-abempty 
(empty path-abempty is replaced by <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml">/well-known</a>/pay)
  ºExamplesº
    $myWebShop.com/invoice/123
    → https://myWebShop.com/invoice/123
    $myWebShop.com 
    → https://myWebShop.com/.well-known/pay

ºQuoting (protocol)º:
  - Allow senders to determine exchange rate between
    their assets (for example USD) and the receiver's 
    assets (for example EUR) before making a payment

ºdigits/precision/scaleº:
  - decimal_digits: a hint for GUIs, the conventionally displayed number of decimal places for a given asset.
  - Precision: number of digits in a number.
  - Scale: number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a number.
  - Examples:
    - 123.45 has a precision of 5 and a scale of 2
    - a USD ledger might use a precision of 15 and a scale of 6 and 2 decimal_digits

└ local transfers 1, 2: PREPARE   PHASE 
local transfers 3, 4: EXECUTION PHASE 
- In the PREPARE PHASE the crypto-condition is "linked" to the payment
  and execution is conditioned to receiving the fulfillment 
  (fulfillment == "cryptographic receipt") before a timeout
- In the universal (non-atomic) mode it's possible for a timeout
  in ledger1 in step 4 after step 3 is executed properly in ledger 2.
  In that case ledger 2 looses money.

- An external "clock" (notary, orderer, oracle in blockchain nomenclature 
  or transaction manager -DDBB nomenclature-) is needed for full atomic-mode

- Alternative to ILP-over-HTTP using a binary protocol
  @michielbdejong 
    """BTP is just a wrapper around ILP packets that makes it 
    easier to send them over WebSockets...
    ... I guess the advantage of HTTP is that it's easier (to implement).
    The Advantage of WebSockets is that it allows a client (so a computer 
    that's not publicly addressable, e.g. a laptop or phone) to be a receiver,
    and that some JavaScript-based connectors may only support WebSockets 
    (but if a JavaScript-based connector wants to peer with a Java-based one,
     it would be easy to add ilp-plugin-http)"""

- BTP Sub-protocols include optional functionality like ledger
  metadata, balance, automated settlement, and dispute resolution.

ºGLOSSARY:º
- BTP Connection: websocket connection over which BTP packets are
                  sent. Websockets (as opposed to raw TLS sockets) are used because 
                  they provide message framing and can be used from the browser.
- BTP Packets   : protocol data units formally defined in ASN.1
- Peers         : are the parties on a BTP connection. Your peer is the party on the
                  other side of the BTP connection.

- request is In-Flight : if the request has been sent out, but no response has been sent yet
- transfer is In-Flight: if it has been prepared but not yet fulfilled nor rejected

ILDCP: stands for Interledger Dynamic Configuration Protocol
- protocol used for transferring node&amp;ledger information from a parent node
  to a child node. The transferred information is:

  - ILP address that the child should use for its own address  : e.g. g.crypto.foo.bar
  - Asset code that the two nodes will use to settle           : e.g. XRP
  - Asset scale used in ILP packets exchanged between the nodes: e.g. 6

Transport
Protocols

<pre zoom>
<span xsmall>Concepts</span>
- A critical function of Interledger Transport Protocols is to determine 
    the path exchange rate and handle any changes in the rate.

- Senders SHOULD judge amounts and prices only in their own units
    using the calculated path exchange rate, because destination units can
    be manipulated by the receiver (by using a connector with an exchange
    rate they control).

- Implementations SHOULD use the ratio of the amount that arrived at the 
    remote endpoint and the amount sent to determine the path exchange rate. 
    They MAY send an unfulfillable test packet when the connection is 
    initiated to estimate the path exchange rate.

- Implementations SHOULD set the minimum acceptable amount in each packet
    sent to prevent the remote endpoint from accepting a packet if the exchange
   rate was worse than expected.

- Implementations SHOULD NOT fulfill incoming Prepare packets with amounts
   less than is specified in the STREAM packet.

<span xsmall>STREAM</span>

@[https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/asn1/Stream.asn]
(replaces PSK2)
Multiplexed Money&amp; ILPv4 Data Transport Protocol

- reliably sends money&amp;data over ILP.
- All STREAM packets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte Initialization Vector (IV) and a 16-Byte Authentication Tag
- Use-cases:
  - streaming payments and/or data
  - Segmenting larger discrete payments and messages into packets and reassembling them
  - Bi-directional communication between two endpoints through ILP
  - Stream multiplexing (sending multiple logical streams of money and/or data over a single connection)
  - Stream- and connection-level flow control (adjusting the rate at which money and data are sent)
  - Congestion control (adjusting the rate at which ILP packets are sent based on network throughput limits)
  - Authenticating and encrypting ILP packet data
  - Generating and fulfilling ILP packet conditions
  - Connection migration

A ºvirtual connectionº is established between "client" and a "server"
that can be used to send authenticated ILP packets between them. That virtual connection
is represented by session-data in both end-points generated through a single shared secret 

- Like PSK2, STREAM ºuses a shared secret to authenticate and encrypt multiple packets,º
ºas well as to generate the conditions and fulfillmentsº.
  In addition, STREAM enables bidirectionaly sending money and data and automatically
determines how much money and data can be sent in each ILP packet.
ºSTREAM borrows heavily from QUIC's packet formatº
DEFINITIONS:
    Stream-ID: Allow different streams to be multiplexed over a single connection

    Client   : The endpoint initiating a STREAM connection
               Client-initiated streams are given odd-Stream-ID-numbers starting with 1
    Server   : The endpoint accepting incoming STREAM connections
               Server-initiated streams are given even-Stream-ID-numbers starting with 2

    ConnectionMaxStreamId: Allow to limit max number of concurrently active incoming streams.
               This parameter must be announced to the peer end-point.
               Implementations SHOULD use a default max stream ID of 20 
               (allowing each endpoint to open up to 10 concurrent streams)

    Sender -  endpoint that ºsends a particular ILP Prepare packetº.
    Receiver - The endpoint that receives a particular ILP Prepare packet 
              and ºresponds with either an ILP Fulfill or Reject packetº.
              A Fulfill response is equivalent to a Packet Acknowledgement (ACK) while
              a Reject response is equivalent to a Packet No-Acknowledgement (NACK)

    ºOnce STREAM connection is established client and server become "peers" and canº
    ºbecome senders or receiversº
    STREAM packet - ºencoded, encrypted and sent as the data field of an (º
         ºPrepare|Fulfill|Reject)ILP-packetº that can be parsed by a STREAM endpoint

    Streams are given numerical IDs to allow stream multiplexing over a single connection.

Application Layer protocols, (SPSP,...) can use STREAM to send money and data between endpoints.

EXCHANGE RATES
STREAM packets include a minimum acceptable amount in ILP Prepare packets and the amount that arrived
at the other endpoint in the response Fulfill/Reject packet.

*Each STREAM packet consists of multiple <span TODO>frames</span>, which 
 can be used to send money, data, or control-related information.*

Connection-Life-Cicle (Creation, use, closing)

ºMATCHING PACKETS TO CONNECTIONSº
  - Incoming packets can either be associated with an existing connection,
    or, for servers, potentially create a new connection.
  - Endpoints MAY append extra segments to the ILP addresses assigned to them by
    their upstream connectors to help direct incoming packets.

Client → server: ConnectionNewAddress-frame indicating Client-ILP-address
Server → Client: (Using encrypted communication channel like HTTPS)
                 (Key exchange is NOT provided by STREAM)
                 - STREAM Version (optional -- assumed to be version 1 unless specified)
                 - Server ILP Address
                 - Cryptographically secure random or pseudorandom shared 
                   secret (it is RECOMMNEDED to use 32 bytes)
                 NOTE:
                 To avoid storing a 32 byte secret for each connection, a server MAY deterministically
                 generate the shared secret for each connection from a single server secret and a nonce
                 appended to the ILP Address given to a particular client, for example by using an HMAC.

HANDLING INCOMMING PACKET:
  connector → receiver: STREAM packets
  receiver → receiver: - decrypt&amp;parse STREAM packet
                       - Reject packets with "F06: Unexpected Payment" 
                         when data cannot be decrypted with expected shared secret  errors.
  
ENDPOINT ILP ADDRESS CHANGE AFTER INITIAL CONNECTION:
  endpoint1 → endpoint2: ConnectionNewAddress-frame indicating new peer-ILP-address
                         - To ensure the new address is received and acknowledged,
                           implementations MAY choose to send these frames only in ILP Prepare packets.
  endpoint1 → endpoint1: Wait for valid response (encrypted with the same shared secret) 
                         from the new address to validate the new path.
                         NOTE: STREAM uses the authenticated request/response packets in lieu
                         of QUIC's explicit Path Validation. Implementations SHOULD refrain from sending 
                         large numbers of packets or large amounts of data to a new ILP address before
                         validating the path to avoid being tricked into participating in a Denial of
                         Service (DoS) attack on a third-party endpoint.

OPENING NEW STREAMS
  -- connection already established, either endpoint can create streams to send money or data--
  endpoint1 → endpoint2: (StreamMoney|StreamData)-frame with a previously unused stream ID.

                           to indicate which stream the money is for.        |                      NOTE: A single ILP Prepare can carry data destined for

                           multiple streams and the shares field in each of 
                           the StreamMoney frames indicates what portion of 
                           the Prepare amount should go to each stream.



    STREAM-LEVEL FLOW CONTROL: Allows an endpoint to limit       the amount of incomming money and data on a particular stream.
CONNECTION-LEVEL FLOW CONTROL: Allows an endpoint to limit total the amount of incomming           data on all          streams.

CLOSING STREAMS
  endpoint1 → endpoint2: StreamClose-frame (normal or error)
                         Implementations MAY allow half-open streams (one side has closed, the other is still able to send)


CLOSING CONNECTIONS
  endpoint1 → endpoint2: ConnectionClose-frame (normal or error)
                         Implementations MAY allow half-open connections (where one side has closed the connection and the other is still able to send).

ENCRYPTION PSEUDOCODE
  - encryption key used for every packet sent for a given connection is the HMAC-SHA256 digest
    of the shared secret and the string "ilp_stream_encryption", encoded as UTF-8 ( or ASCII since they match)

    var iv = random_bytes(12);
    var encryption_key = hmac_sha256(shared_secret, "ilp_stream_encryption");
    var { ciphertext, auth_tag } = aes_256_gcm(encryption_key, iv, data);

<span xsmall>SPSP</span>
@[https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol.md]
SPSP: Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP)
Basic protocol targeting end-user apps for ºexchanging payment informationº between senders and receivers 
in order to facilitate payment details (ILP address, shared secret, ...) using HTTPS to exchange SPSP messages

SPSP uses the STREAM transport protocol for condition generation and data encoding.

Notice the creation of a new  STREAM payment needs also basic receiver details provided by SPSP.

Use-Cases:
- sender digital wallet using SPSP to initiate payments.
- SPSP clients and receivers use ILP modules to send and
  receive Interledger payments.
- SPSP payment-pointers can be used as a persistent identifier
  on Interledger. SPSP payment-pointers can also be used as a unique identifier for an invoice to be paid.

OPERATION:
-------- Pre-setup -----
SPSP receiver → HTTPS Server: Create/expose SPSP (HTTP GET) Endpoint
SPSP receiver announces SPSP Endpoint to sender by any method/channel
(sender and receiver use the STREAM transport protocol to generate the ILP packets)
-------- Payment pre-setup -----
SPSP_sender   → SPSP_Endpoint: query type-of-payment information available for reciever
SPSP_sender   ← SPSP_Endpoint: response including (receiver's ILP address, shared secret),...
                               Optionally can include:
                               -  balance associated with SPSP receiver, i.e. in the case of an invoice.
SPSP_sender   → SPSP_receiver: constructs ILP payment 
-------- Start Payment -----
(SPSP_sender←→SPSP_receiver) → +ILP/STREAM_connection:
SPSP_sender  → ILP/STREAM_connection:  +STREAM-stream
SPSP_sender  → ILP/STREAM_connection:  adjust sendMax to reflect max amount they're willing to send
SPSP_receiver→ ILP/STREAM_connection:  adjust receiveMax to reflect the amount they're willing to receive

The sender's and receiver's STREAM modules will move as much value as possible while staying inside these bounds.
If the sender reaches their sendMax, they end the stream and the connection. If the receiver reaches their receiveMax,
they will end the STREAM and the connection.

Sender SHOULD treat the URI as opaque:

There are several supported ways to refer to an SPSP endpoint:
  - Payment-pointer : (    Recommended) $alice.example.com, $example.com/bob,...:
                      - SHOULD be the only kind of SPSP identifier exposed to users(GUIs).
  - Raw endpoint URI: (Not recommended):  https://.../spsp/alice.
                      - SHOULD NOT be exposed to users (GUIs), 
                      - SHOULD be supported by SPSP clients.


SPSP Endpoint MUST respond to HTTPS GET requests in the following manner:

REQUEST
→ GET /.well-known/pay HTTP/1.1
→ Host: example.com
→ Accept: application/spsp4+json, application/spsp+json

- <a href='https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/309'>PR #309: Replace ILQP with End-to-End Quoting</a>
- end-to-end protocol implemented by Interledger senders and receivers (not connectors, in contrast to ILQPv1)
- ILQPv2 assumes all connector exchange rates are linear and that there are no fixed fees (no Liquidity Curves)
- Senders may use a dedicated quoting module or ILQPv2 may be included in a Transport Layer protocol

- connectors MUST ignore the amount in the ILP Packet, and neither attempt to deliver the exact amount in the packet or reject payments where the transfer amount is lower than the amount in the packet and MUST relay error messages back to the sender.

- generalization of the idea of a Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) used in 
  Bitcoin/Lightning Network term for conditional transfers where the
  conditions and timeouts are enforced by the ledger.
- Hashlocks and timeouts can be enforced by ledgers or they can be 
  upheld by senders and recipients themselves. (In ILPv4+ a ledger is
  considered just another connector)

<span xsmall>Tunning TIMEOUTS in UNIVERSAL</span>
<span xsmall>(non-atomic) mode</span>

- Timeout scenario:
      sender  → connector1 → connector2 → receiver
              │            │            │ ← fulfill─ │
+10 msecs     │            │ ← fulfill─ │            │
+ 3  secs  timeout     timeout        on-time     on-time

  If the fulfillment arrives to connector2 it will execute pending on-hold 
money from connector1, but since the fulfillment arrives late to connector1, 
both sender and connector1 (that were waiting for up to a timeout for the 
fulfillment response) will rollback. Sender gets its money back but connector1
, that was already paid to connector2, is not rewarded and looses money.

- Avoiding timeouts warrants atomicity for the distributed transaction. 
  Nothingless, the default mode of operation just warrants that
  "most" of the times the transaction will be atomic except for a few 
  scenarios where race-condition can arise.

  """It's possible that at some point there is an overload in the destination ledger. At this point the average time to process
    the incomming transfer, executing and returning the fulfillment will increase approaching the initial timeout.
    The closer it is to the timeout the more probable for race condition during the "travel back"."""
    Different solutions exists for safe (timeout-free) solutions, like using an external clock acting as "notary" or "judge"
    deciding deterministically when a payment timed-out or not. Also "very big" timeouts will suffice.
  
- Setting correct timeouts in essential for proper network performance.
  Using "big timeouts" will be safer but will block money in the escrow and decrease the liquidity
  We also want to minimize the risk or race-condition when payment is fulfilled in the receiving ledger
  but rejected on the sending ledger due to a timeout in the window-time when the fulfillment is
  returning back to the originating (sending) ledger.

    """....we haven't abandoned the ideal insofar ...
       we still want any many payments as possible to be atomic ...
       we cannot assume that atomic mode will always be available.
       ... all participants along the payment chain have to have full
       unconditional trust in the notary ... in order to be able to use
       atomic mode all of the time, there must be at least one notary that 
       is trusted by all people in the world. Otherwise, we may
       run into situations where a liquidity path is available, but no valid
       notary can be selected.
       
       It is possible to use multiple notaries in a payment, but that actually
       doesn't make the trust problem easier and arguably makes it harder... 
       then we now need all participants to trust notaries such that none 
       of the notaries they trust would ever collude with any other notary they trust.
       
       ...
      ºIt is possible to use atomic mode in the context of a universal mode       º
      ºpayment. Any number of participants can decide to make the transfer betweenº
      ºthem subsidiary to some notary. If all the participants do that,           º
      ºcongratulations, the payment is fully atomic.                              º

       Ripple is currently building a proprietary network for banks that uses
       atomic mode internally and universal mode externally.
       
       ...XRP Atomic Mode Autodetection (XAMA). The idea is to allow participants in 
       a payment to detect that XRP is used as one of the hops and then defer to
       the outcome of the XRP transaction instead of using their own timeouts, 
       effectively making the XRP Ledger a de-facto notary.
        This can be generalized as a defer-right and defer-left behavior.
        Any neighboring pair of participants (:= sender|receiver|connector) can
       - by mutual agreement - decide to defer the outcome of their
       transfer to whatever the outcome on the ledger right of them or the ledger
       left of them.

- Early on in the project the goal was to define a standard interface for 
"ledgers" which would abstract away the functions of a particular ledger and 
expose the functions required of a sender, receiver or connector. Given that 
the technology of choice for the majority of contributors at the time was 
Javascript, this was done in Javascript and described in

dora-gt Is there any material to refer about amount control, like... 
- if I want to send $10 by XRP, how to control destination amount?
- if I want the receiver to receive just $10. How to make it accurate in the higher layer without using ILQP.

Evan Schwartz @emschwartz Feb 04 19:22 @dora-gt great question. 
That type of functionality is now in the transport layer, rather than the Interledger layer:
- If you want to specify a minimum that the receiver should accept for a certain packet, 
  that can be included in the ILP Prepare data as is done in PSK2
  (https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/384/files#diff-d46f90d06e8466d8aba6f793b0f26a25R167 )
- If you want to determine the path exchange rate you can send an unfulfillable test payment and 
   ask the receiver how much arrived, also done in PSK2 
  (https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/384/files#diff-d46f90d06e8466d8aba6f793b0f26a25R203 ).

- The two major changes with ILPv4:
  - some of the fields moved from  Ledger Layer's transfer object UP to the ILP packet (Interledger layer)

  - some of the functionality that was in the Interledger layer was moved into the transport layer.

  We realized that you could get the same benefits from ILQP and having the fixed destination amount
  in the ILP packet without needing all of the connectors and the core of the network
  to have special functionality for that

The changes I do think affect functionality when seen from the outside, are:

Q: Hi interledger community,

I have followed development of interledger from the inception, but i have struggled to understand all possible applications it can be used for.

I read blog post about HTTP-ILP: Paid API Calls with Interledger and I understood how beneficial this could and offer some advantages for the API project im working on.

In brief we are building merchant to wallet API. It enables mobile wallet providers to implement shopping features into their wallets
from pool of merchants, through an API we are providing.

My question is, How big of a job this is to implement with existing software and is there any example APIs that have implemented
paid API calls in production?

A: Hi @Hiirihii, welcome to the Interledger chat! For larger payments you probably want to look at the Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP) https://medium.com/interledger-blog/spsp-simple-payment-setup-protocol-2028292e6925 and https://github.com/sharafian/ilp-spsp-invoice-server rather than HTTP-ILP
Sorry @nathanawmk, this isn't the place for questions about ripplenet. You can find more information about it at https://ripple.com/solutions/process-payments/ or use the contact form there to get in touch with folks that can answer questions about it

I'm trying to understand how the plugins handle payment channels. Wondering if this is this correct:

    plugin.connect() creates a channel via on chain transaction (if it doesn't exist already)
    plugin.sendMoney() creates and sends a paychan claim via BTP
    plugin.handleMoney() recieves paychan claims via BTP and checks they are valid
    plugin.disconnect() closes out the channel by submitting, on chain, the last stored claim

Also, do the plugins monitor their blockchain for fraudulent paychan claim submissions or is that left out for now?

@michielbdejong
mar. 24 07:31
that looks correct! what do you mean with fraudulent submissions? the receiver only has to check that the sender's claim is valid, and submit it, right?
________________

"""Basically moneyd is an ILP connector that is pre-configured to automatically peer with any publicly reachable ILP connector. You can run a connector manually, but it's a lot more involved. It requires maintenance and configuration to keep it up to date and manage your peering relationships with other major connectors. If you want to deploy a publicly accessible connector you can follow the instructions here: https://github.com/interledgerjs/tf-connector , but you might find it tricky unless you're familiar with the stack.

If you want to run a local setup of Interledger, you can use moneyd local (https://github.com/interledgerjs/moneyd-xrp#local-test-network). That would work similarly to the configuration you proposed, in which the connector has no external connections. You can use this mode to pay between programs connected to your local moneyd instance.

If you want to run a connector that connects through XRP on the test network, you can use moneyd on the testnet (https://github.com/interledgerjs/moneyd-xrp#test-network) which will automatically manage payment channels over XRP. We're also working on Ethereum and Lightning support, although they're not in the moneyd package yet.

What do you want to do on Interledger? I can tell you which setup would make the most sense

successor to PSK2
<pre zoom>
- Application Layer protocols, such as the Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP)
 can use STREAM to send money and data between endpoints.
- Multiplexed Bi-directional Money and Data Transport for ILP for reliably
    sending multiple "logical streams" of money and data between two parties
    over ILP
- Designed for applications involving streaming payments or data,
    as well as those requiring sending larger discrete payments and messages
- A virtual connection is established between a "client" and a "server" and
    can be used to send authenticated ILP packets between them
- Provides connection-level flow (congestion) control, adjusting the rate
     at which money and data are sent
- ILP packet data Authentication and encryption
- Generating and fulfilling ILP packet conditions
- Connection migration
- Like PSK2, STREAM uses a shared secret to authenticate and
   encrypt multiple packets, as well as to generate the conditions and fulfillments.
    In addition, STREAM enables sending money and data in both directions between
   the two endpoints and automatically determines how much money and data can be
   sent in each ILP packet. STREAM borrows heavily from QUIC's packet format, 
   stream multiplexing, and approach to flow control.
DEFINITIONS 
Client    - endpoint initiating STREAM connection
Server    - endpoint accepting incoming STREAM connections
Endpoint  - client or server end of a connection, which can be the
            sender or receiver of money and/or data
            - Endpoints.ConnectionMaxStreamId indicates max. number of
              of concurrently active incoming streams supported. Must
              be indicated to the peer endpoint. Implementations SHOULD
              use a default max stream ID of 20, which allows each endpoint
              to open up to 10 concurrent streams.
            - Endpoint.StreamMaxMoney: advertises max. amount of money it's 
              willing to receive,
            - Endpoint.StreamMaxData: Advertises maximum number of bytes each 
              stream can receive.
            - Endpoints.ConnectionMaxData advertises the total number of bytes it's 
              willing to receive on a given connection summing up all streams.


Connection- The session established between two endpoints that
            uses a single shared secret and multiplexes multiple 
            streams of money and/or data
Sender    - endpoint that sends a particular ILP Prepare packet.
            Because STREAM connections are bi-directional, either
            endpoint can be the sender of a given packet
Receiver  - The endpoint that receives a particular ILP Prepare
            packet and responds with either an ILP Fulfill or
            Reject packet. Because STREAM connections are bi-directional,
            either endpoint can be the receiver of a given packet
Stream    - A logical, bi-directional channel of ordered bytes and
            money within a STREAM connection
            Streams are given numerical IDs. Client-initiated streams
            are given odd numbers starting with 1 and server-initiated
            streams are given even numbers starting with 2.


Shared Secret - A cryptographically-secure random seed that is shared
            between the two endpoints comprising a connection and is 
            used to derive keys for encrypting packets and generating 
            conditions and fulfillments
STREAM packet - A payload sent as the data portion of an ILP packet that
            can be parsed by a STREAM endpoint
</pre>

5.1.1. Encryption Envelope

Field      Type         Description
Random IV  12-Byte UInt Nonce used as input to the AES-GCM algorithm.
                        Also ensures conditions are random.
                        Endpoints MUST NOT encrypt two packets with
                        the same nonce
Authentication Tag  16-Byte UInt    Authentication tag produced by AES-GCM encryption that ensures data integrity
Ciphertext  0-32739 Bytes   Encrypted data (see below for contents)

Note that the Ciphertext is NOT length-prefixed. The length can be inferred from the ILP packet because the whole data field is encoded with a length prefix. (This is done so that the entire data field is indistinguishable from random bytes.)
5.1.2. Encryption Pseudocode

The encryption key used for every packet sent for a given connection is the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the shared secret and the string "ilp_stream_encryption", encoded as UTF-8 or ASCII (the byte representation is the same with both encodings).

var iv = random_bytes(12);
var encryption_key = hmac_sha256(shared_secret, "ilp_stream_encryption");
var { ciphertext, auth_tag } = aes_256_gcm(encryption_key, iv, data);

5.1.3. Maximum Number of Packets Per Connection

Implementations MUST close the connection once either endpoint has sent 2^31 packets. According to NIST, it is unsafe to use AES-GCM for more than 2^32 packets using the same encryption key. (STREAM uses the limit of 2^31 because both endpoints encrypt packets with the same key.)
5.2. STREAM Packet

See the ASN.1 definition for the formal packet specification.
Field   Type    Description
Version     UInt8   1 for this version
ILP Packet Type     UInt8   ILPv4 packet type this STREAM packet MUST be sent in (12 for Prepare, 13 for Fulfill, and 14 for Reject). Endpoints MUST discard STREAM packets that comes in on the wrong ILP Packet Type. (This is done to prevent malicious intermediaries from swapping the data fields from different valid ILP packets.)
Sequence    VarUInt     Identifier for an ILP request / response. Clients and Servers track their own outgoing packet sequence numbers and increment the Sequence for each ILP Prepare they send. The Receiver MUST respond with a STREAM packet that includes the same Sequence as the Sender's Prepare packet. A sender MUST discard a STREAM packet in which the Sequence does not match the STREAM packet sent with their ILP Prepare.
Prepare Amount  VarUInt     If the STREAM packet is sent on an ILP Prepare, this represents the minimum the receiver should accept. If the packet is sent on an ILP Fulfill or Reject, this represents the amount that the receiver got in the Prepare.
Frames  SEQUENCE OF Frame   An array of Frames, which are specified below.
Junk Data   N/A     Extra bytes that MUST be ignored. Implementations MAY append zero-bytes to pad packets to a specific size. Future versions of STREAM may specify additional fields that come after the Frames (zero-bytes MUST be used for padding to avoid confusion with future protocol versions).
5.3. Frames

See the ASN.1 definition for the formal specification of the frame encoding and each frame type.

Each frame is encoded with its 1-byte type and length prefix. Implementations MUST ignore frames with unknown types. Future versions of STREAM may add new frame types.
Field   Type    Description
Type    UInt8   Identifier for the frame type (see below)
Data    Variable-Length Octet String    Frame contents

The frame types are as follows and each is described in greater detail below:
Type ID     Frame
0x01    Connection Close
0x02    Connection New Address
0x03    Connection Max Data
0x04    Connection Data Blocked
0x05    Connection Max Stream ID
0x06    Connection Stream ID Blocked
0x10    Stream Close
0x11    Stream Money
0x12    Stream Money Max
0x13    Stream Money Blocked
0x14    Stream Data
0x15    Stream Data Max
0x16    Stream Data Blocked
5.3.1. ConnectionClose Frame
Field   Type    Description
Error Code  UInt8   Machine-readable Error Code indicating why the connection was closed.
Error Message   Utf8String  Human-readable string intended to give more information helpful for debugging purposes.

If implementations allow half-open connections, an endpoint MAY continue sending packets after receiving a ConnectionClose frame. Otherwise, the endpoint MUST close the connection immediately.
5.3.2. ConnectionNewAddress Frame
Field   Type    Description
Source Address  ILP Address     New ILP address of the endpoint that sent the frame.
5.3.3. ConnectionMaxData Frame
Field   Type    Description
Max Offset  VarUInt     The total number of bytes the endpoint is willing to receive on this connection.

Endpoints MUST NOT exceed the total number of bytes the other endpoint is willing to accept.
5.3.4. ConnectionDataBlocked Frame
Field   Type    Description
Max Offset  VarUInt     The total number of bytes the endpoint wants to send.
5.3.5. ConnectionMaxStreamId Frame
Field   Type    Description
Max Stream ID   VarUInt     The maximum stream ID the endpoint is willing to accept.
5.3.6. ConnectionStreamIdBlocked Frame
Field   Type    Description
Max Stream ID   VarUInt     The maximum stream ID the endpoint wishes to open.
5.3.7. StreamClose Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Error Code  UInt8   Machine-readable Error Code indicating why the stream was closed.
Error Message   Utf8String  Human-readable string intended to give more information helpful for debugging purposes.

If implementations allow half-open streams, an endpoint MAY continue sending money or data for this stream after receiving a StreamClose frame. Otherwise, the endpoint MUST close the stream immediately.
5.3.8. StreamMoney Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Shares  VarUInt     Proportion of the ILP Prepare amount destined for the stream specified.

The amount of money that should go to each stream is calculated by dividing the number of shares for the given stream by the total number of shares in all of the StreamMoney frames in the packet.

For example, if an ILP Prepare packet has an amount of 100 and three StreamMoney frames with 5, 15, and 30 shares for streams 2, 4, and 6, respectively, that would indicate that stream 2 should get 10 units, stream 4 gets 30 units, and stream 6 gets 60 units.

If the Prepare amount is not divisible by the total number of shares, implementations SHOULD round the stream amounts down. The remainder SHOULD be allocated to the lowest-numbered open stream that has not reached its maximum receive amount.
5.3.9. StreamMaxMoney Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Receive Max     VarUInt     Total amount, denominated in the units of the endpoint sending this frame, that the endpoint is willing to receive on this stream.
Total Received  VarUInt     Total amount, denominated in the units of the endpoint sending this frame, that the endpoint has received thus far.

The amounts in this frame are denominated in the units of the endpoint sending the frame, so the other endpoint must use their calculated exchange rate to determine how much more they can send for this stream.
5.3.10. StreamMoneyBlocked Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Send Max    VarUInt     Total amount, denominated in the units of the endpoint sending this frame, that the endpoint wants to send.
Total Sent  VarUInt     Total amount, denominated in the units of the endpoint sending this frame, that the endpoint has sent already.
5.3.11. StreamData Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Offset  VarUInt     Position of this data in the byte stream.
Data    VarOctetString  Application data.

Packets may be received out of order so the Offset is used to indicate the correct position of the byte segment in the overall stream. The first StreamData frame sent for a given stream MUST start with an Offset of zero.
5.3.12. StreamMaxData Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Max Offset  VarUInt     The total number of bytes the endpoint is willing to receive on this stream.
5.3.13. StreamDataBlocked Frame
Field   Type    Description
Stream ID   VarUInt     Identifier of the stream this frame refers to.
Max Offset  VarUInt     The total number of bytes the endpoint wants to send on this stream.
5.4. Error Codes

Error codes are sent in StreamClose and ConnectionClose frames to indicate what caused the stream or connection to be closed.
Error Code  Name    Description
0x01    NoError     Indicates the stream or connection closed normally.
0x02    InternalError   The endpoint encountered an unexpected error.
0x03    EndpointBusy    The endpoint is temporarily overloaded and unable to process the packet.
0x04    FlowControlError    The other endpoint exceeded the flow control limits advertised.
0x05    StreamIdError   The other endpoint opened more streams than allowed.
0x06    StreamStateError    The other endpoint sent frames for a stream that is already closed.
0x07    FrameFormatError    The other endpoint sent a frame with invalid syntax.
0x08    ProtocolViolation   The other endpoint sent invalid data or otherwise violated the protocol.
0x09    ApplicationError    The application using STREAM closed the stream or connection with an error.
6. Condition and Fulfillment Generation

There are two methods the sender can use to generate the condition, depending on whether they want the payment to be fulfillable or not.
6.1. Unfulfillable Condition

If the sender does not want the receiver to be able to fulfill the payment (as for an informational quote), they can generate an unfulfillable random condition.

var condition = random_bytes(32);

6.2. Fulfillable Condition

If the sender does want the receiver to be able to fulfill the condition, the condition MUST be generated in the following manner.

The shared_secret is the cryptographic seed exchanged during Setup. The string "ilp_stream_fulfillment" is encoded as UTF-8 or ASCII (the byte representation is the same with both encodings). The data is the encrypted STREAM packet.

var hmac_key = hmac_sha256(shared_secret, "ilp_stream_fulfillment");
var fulfillment = hmac_sha256(hmac_key, data);
var condition = sha256(fulfillment);

6.3. Fulfillment Generation

The following pseudocode details how the receiver regenerates the fulfillment from the data.

The shared_secret is the cryptographic seed exchanged during Setup. The string "ilp_stream_fulfillment" is encoded as UTF-8 or ASCII (the byte representation is the same with both encodings). The data is the encrypted STREAM packet.

var hmac_key = hmac_sha256(shared_secret, "ilp_stream_fulfillment");
var fulfillment = hmac_sha256(hmac_key, data);

Appendix A: Similarities and Differences with QUIC

Unlike QUIC, STREAM:

    Has only one packet header instead of QUIC's short and long headers.
    Uses the shared secret to identify the Connection rather than having a separate Connection ID.
    Does not include a cryptographic handshake, because STREAM assumes a symmetric secret is communicated out of band.
    Does not support unidirectional frames. The QUIC community had significant debate over whether to include unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams, or both. They settled on both primarily to support the HTTP request/response pattern as well as HTTP/2 Server Push. Unidirectional streams were left out of STREAM because they add complexity and are a premature optimization for this protocol now.
    Does not have ACK frames, because ILP Prepare packets must be acknowledged with either a Fulfill or Reject packet. If the response includes an (authenticated) STREAM packet, the sender can treat that as an acknowledgement of the control and data frames from the Prepare packet they sent.
    Does not have Ping, Path Challenge, or Path Challenge Response frames, because a STREAM packet with no frames can be used instead. As long as the Client and Server increment the packet sequence for each packet they send, a valid Fulfill or Reject packet from the Receiver that includes the correct sequence in the encrypted data serves as the path challenge and response.

JFYI, I just found there was an agreement called ?TBT?.
If ILP is defined on ISO, that might be great to be spread over the world.

Are multi plugins assumed to have infinite liquidity? e.g., should they throw an error in sendData if the server does not have enough money to cover the PREPARE? Or is that something implemented at the connector level?
Ben Sharafian @sharafian Jul 18 20:20
multi plugins do all their balance internally so from the connector's perspective they have infinite balance
_________________________________
Jul 18 20:54 For multi plugins (take eth over machinomy for example), the ILP address is no longer of the form g.ilp.eth.<eth_address> but rather g.ilp.eth.<token> which is a hashed value that cannot be used to reconstruct the eth_address. What is the reason for this?
Ben Sharafian @sharafian Jul 18 21:03 The ethereum address is just a settlement detail, but doesn't say anything about the actual network topology. You could have multiple peering relationships using the same ethereum account but with different Interledger addresses, or you could theoretically have a link that you settle with multiple different addresses. Interledger is a network that exists on top of settlement infrastructure so we don't try to make any 1:1 mapping from the settlement network to the interledger network

I've been battling issues with our new firewall appliances the last couple days and havent had a chance to get back to the I'll connector ... Will try to get back at it tonight, so I'll be looking for a peer list too!
Adrian Hope-Bailie @adrianhopebailie Jul 23 23:10 @Reverend_Ripple_twitter cool, when you're ready you need to:
    Decide if you'll run the BTP server or client (client is easier because you won't need to open any new incoming ports)
    Give me your Ripple address
    If you're gonna run a server then also give me the BTP server URL of the XRP paychan plugin you configured
Best if you share these all via a direct message :smile:

Hi all,

As discussed on the call this week I've been working on some load testing tools.
They are still pretty rough but are good enough to start experimenting with.
This repo has some scripts to generate the JMeter test plan, user config and connector configuration.
https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/ilp-load-test

This is the code for the JMeter plugin you'll need.
https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/jmeter-ilp-samplers

Once these are cleaned up they'll get pulled into the relevant project repos.
Happy load testing!

Hi  all,

Interledger and ILP/STREAM play an important role in the exciting field of what you could call "Network Ledger Technology".

If you're interested in trustlines, hashlock conditions, multi-hop payments, liquidity routing in general, beyond their use in ILP/STREAM specifically, then please feel welcome to join this cross-project mailing list I created, where we can all showcase our (hobby) projects and learn from each other's innovations:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/network-money

Hope to see you there, and happy hacking!


Cheers,
Michiel.

- We can consider to simplify that transfers in a same asset
 from sender to receiver are zero-cost and can be executed
  easely by any mechanism.

Question: Where do non-zero-cost TX appears?
Answer  : They appear anytime when there is some risk

What are the sources of risks:
  (asset can be source or destination unless otherwise specified)
- payer/payee asset has a fast varying random price through time compared to payee/payer asset.
  Even if the TX executes in millisecs we can not be sure that the applied (probably cached) exchange is correct.

- payer/payee asset has a fast varying increasing price through time compared to payee/payer asset.

- An asset must be physically transported. For example senders pays in dollars, receivers recieves gold.
  The gold will take time to arrive.

- The asset associated-ledger balance (public status) is false.
  The connector can loose money. The risk is bigger the "less-trustable" is the ledger. 
  "less-trustable" means in practice "small" and not "back-supported".
