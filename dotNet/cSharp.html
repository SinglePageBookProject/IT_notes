<span xsmall>C# Types</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/]
- compiler embeds type information into the executable file as metadata.
- The common language runtime (CLR) uses that metadata at run time to
  further guarantee type safety when it allocates and reclaims memory.


ºUsing type dynamicº (C# 4+)
- static type, but an object of type dynamic bypasses static type checking.
- In most cases, it functions like it has type object. 
- At compile time, an element that is typed as dynamic is assumed to support 
  any operation.
  - Errors are caught at run time.
  - object can gets its value from COM API, script-language like IronPython, DOM,
    reflection,....

ºDynamic language runtime (.NET Framework 4+)º
- Provides the infrastructure that supports the dynamic type in C#
  and implementation of dynamic programming languages (IronPython, IronRuby,...)


ºBitConverter classº
Type        Method
returned
bool        ToBoolean(Byte[], Int32)
char        ToChar(Byte[], Int32)
double      ToDouble(Byte[], Int32)
short       ToInt16(Byte[], Int32)
int         ToInt32(Byte[], Int32)
long        ToInt64(Byte[], Int32)
float       ToSingle(Byte[], Int32)
ushort      ToUInt16(Byte[], Int32)
uint        ToUInt32(Byte[], Int32)
ulong       ToUInt64(Byte[], Int32)


º Convert String to a Numberº
- Parse    : Raises exception
  Ex: int result   = Int32.Parse(input);
- TryParse : return false on error 
  Ex: bool parseOK =  Int32.TryParse("-105", out int j)
                                                     ^
                                               parse result in j

- Convert class methods:  Raises exception
  Numeric   Method
  Type
  decimal   ToDecimal(String)
  float     ToSingle(String)
  double    ToDouble(String)
  short     ToInt16(String)
  int       ToInt32(String)
  long      ToInt64(String)
  ushort    ToUInt16(String)
  uint      ToUInt32(String)
  ulong     ToUInt64(String)

  var numVal = Convert.ToInt32(input);
}

ºConvert Hex-strings to/from Numeric Typesº
- Example: output hex value of each character in a string. 

  char[] values = "Hello World!".ToCharArray();
  foreach (char letter in values) {
      int value = Convert.ToInt32(letter);
      Console.WriteLine($"Hex.value of {letter} is {value:X}");
  }

- Example: parse string of hexadecimal values and outputs the
  character corresponding to each hexadecimal value. 
  string[] hexValuesSplit = "48 65 6C 6C 6F".Split(' ');
  foreach (string hex in hexValuesSplit) {
      int value = Convert.ToInt32(hex, 16);
      string stringValue = Char.ConvertFromUtf32(value);
      char charValue = (char)value;
      Console.WriteLine(
        "hex value = {0}, int value = {1}, char value = {2} or {3}",
        hex, value, stringValue, charValue);
  }

- Example: convert hex.string to integer using Parse
  int num = Int32.Parse(
                "8E2",
                System.Globalization.NumberStyles.HexNumber);

Example: convert hex-string to float using System.BitConverter:
uint num = uint.Parse(
               "F34A0170", 
               System.Globalization.NumberStyles.AllowHexSpecifier);
byte[] floatVals = BitConverter.GetBytes(num);
float f = BitConverter.ToSingle(floatVals, 0);

Class/Struct Members:
    Fields
    Constants
    Properties
    Methods
    Constructors
    Events
    Finalizers
    Indexers
    Operators
    Nested Types

- Abstract Classes: Base classes with "template" implementation for children classes.
- Sealed   Classes: Final implementation that can NOT be inherited.

Partial Types:
 - Define class "segments" splited into files.





-ºSystem.Object is the implicit base class for all value types and reference types.º
 ºValueType and ReferenceType inherit for this Objectº


ºClass Equalityº:
- (object2.Equals(object1)) ← true if both instances refer to the same location in memory (same identity) 
-  object2 == object1       ← true if both instances hold the same values.

public struct PostalAddress
{
    // Fields, properties, methods and events go here...
}

Structs limitations:
- Within a struct declaration, fields cannot be initialized unless they are declared as const or static.
- No default constructor (parameterless) or finalizer.
- cannot inherit from structs or class,
- Can implement interfaces.
- cannot be the base of a class.
- ºcannot be nullº

public struct Coords {
    public int x, y;

    public Coords(int p1, int p2) {
        x = p1; y = p2;
    }
}

ºAbstract and Virtual Methodsº
- virtual  method: => derived class CAN  override the method with its own implementation. 
- abstract method: => derived class MUST override the method with its own implementation 
                                    ^^^^
                                    Otherwise derived class remains abstract
                      
ºVersioning with the Override and New Keywordsº

- C# language is designed so that versioning between base and derived classes
   in different libraries can evolve and maintain backward compatibility. 
  - For example, the introduction of a new member in a base class with the
    same name as a member in a derived class is completely supported by
    C# and does not lead to unexpected behavior.
  - It also means that a class must explicitly state whether a method is intended
    to override an inherited method, or whether a method is a new method that
    hides a similarly named inherited method.

- Base classes must be declared as virtual if re-implementation in children is planned.
- Children classes must mark methods as "new" or "override" to indicate their intention
  when the method signature match one of the parent class.


  


ºStruct/Class Properties:º
- methods on a class that are accessed as if they were fields on that class.
  Amongst others, can provide protection for a class field to keep it from
  being changed without the knowledge of the object.

ºStruct/Class Events:º
- provide notifications about events (life-cicle, async-external input, ....)
- Defined and triggered by using delegates.

ºStruct/Class Events:º
- Enable n object to be indexed in a manner similar to arrays.

ºClass Finalizers:º
- Very rarely in C#, called by the runtime execution engine when
  the object is about to be removed from memory. 
- Generally used to make sure that any external resources (I/O devices,...)
  which must be released are handled appropriately.

ºVisibility modifiers:º
1. public   : visible to code in same or different assembly
2. internal : visible to code in same              assembly
3. protected: visible to code in same              assembly and derived class in different assembly.
    internal 
4. private  : visible to code in same              assembly in the same or derived class
   protected 
5. private  : visible to code inside the class 
6. protected: visible to code inside the class or derived classes.


ºExpression body abreviation forº
public class SaleItem {
   string _name;
   decimal _cost;
   
   public SaleItem(string name, decimal cost) {
      _name = name;
      _cost = cost;
   }

   public string Name {
      get => _name;
      set => _name = value;
   }

   public decimal Price {
      get => _cost;
      set => _cost = value; 
   }
}



ºPassing Parameters by value/by referenceº
    static void squareVal(    int valParameter) { ...  }  ← By value
    static void squareRef(ref int refParameter) { ...  }  ← By reference
    ...
    int arg = 4;
    squareVal(arg);      ← Passing by value
    squareRef(ref arg);  ← Passing by reference

ºExtension Methodsº
-  enables to "add" methods to 
   existing types without creating a new derived type,
   recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
   They are actually static methods that can be 
   called using the syntax of the class instance method. 

- most common extension methods:
  - ºLINQº standard to add query operator functionality to the existing
    System.Collections.IEnumerable and
    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> types.
    Ussage:
       using System.Linq
       ...
       int[] ints = { 10,21, 15};
       var result = intsº.OrderBy(g => g);º  // ← Any type implementing IEnumerable<T> (int[])
                                          // will appears to have instance methods such as GroupBy,
                                          // OrderBy, Average, and so on.
       foreach (var i in result) {
          System.Console.Write(i + " "); // → 10 15 21
       }           

  namespace ExtensionMethods {
    public static class MyExtensions {
      public ºstaticº int WordCount(ºthisº String str) {
      //                          ^^^^
      //                    - mark the static method as an extension one
        return str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '.', '?' }, 
          StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
      }
    }
  }
  Ussage:
  using ExtensionMethods;  
  string s = "Hello Extension Methods";  
  int i = s.WordCount();  




ºHow to: Initialize Objects by Using an Object Initializer (C# Programming Guide)º
- allows to initialize type objects in a declarative manner
  without explicitly invoking a constructor for the type.

StudentName type by using object initializers. This example sets properties in the StudentName type:
C#

StudentName student1 = new StudentName(   // Alt 1: Constructor
                             "Craig",
                             "Playstead");

StudentName student2 = new StudentName {  // Alt 2: Object initializer

How to initialize a dictionary with a collection initializer (C# Programming Guide)
 
ºNested Typesº
class Container {
    class ºNestedClassº {
        Nested() { }
    }
}

ºPartial Classesº
- It is possible to split the definition of a class, a struct, an interface or
  a method over two or more source files. Each source file contains a section of
  the type or method definition, and all parts are combined when the application is compiled.

- Useful for example when working with automatically generated source, code can be added
  to the class without having to recreate the source file.

file1:                                    file2:
[SerializableAttribute]                   [ObsoleteAttribute]
public ºpartialº class Employee {           public ºpartialº class Employee {
    public void DoWork() { ... }              public void GoToLunch() { ...  }
}                                         }
NOTE: At compile time, attributes of partial-type definitions are merged. 


ºPartial Methods inside partial classesº
- One part of the class contains the signature of the method.
- An optional implementation may be defined in the same part or another part.
- If the implementation is not supplied, then the method and all calls to the
  method are removed at compile time.


ºAnonymous Typesº
var v = new {          ← anonymous type initialized with two properties
      Amount = 108,      convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only properties
      Message = "Hello"
};  
  
- Ex. ussage: 
  - select clause of a (LINQ) query expression to return a subset of the properties
    from each object in the source sequence. 
    var productQuery =                   ← compiler provides the same name
          from prod in products            as the property being used to
          select new                       initialize them ano. member names 
               { prod.Color, prod.Price }; if no name is specified
    foreach (var v in productQuery) {
        Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", v.Color, v.Price);
    }

<span xsmall>Interfaces</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/]
- Interface == Contract for class
               it does NOT provide implementation, only the obligations of classes.
- TO simulate inheritance in struct, interfaces must also be used.
- Interfaces can     contain methods, properties, events, indexers
- Interfaces can NOT contain constants, fields, operators, instance constructors,
  finalizers, or types.

interface IEquatable˂T˃{   ← By convention name start with capital I
    bool Equals(T obj);
}
interface IPrintable<T> {
    string Print();
}

public class Car : IEquatable<Car>, IPrintable<Car>
{
  public string Make {get; set;}
  public string Model { get; set; }

  public bool Equals(Car car) {
    return this.Make == car.Make &&
           this.Model == car.Model;
  }
  public int IPrintable.Print() {
    //       ^^^^^^^^^^             
    //       Explicit iface
    //       can NOT be accesed from class instance
    //       only, as generic IPrintable instances
    ...
  }
}

- Properties and indexers of a class can define extra accessors for a property 
  or indexer that's defined in an interface.
- For example, an interface might declare a property that has a get accessor.
- The class that implements the interface can declare the same property
  with both a get and set accessor.

<span xsmall>Delegates</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/]
Alt 1:
  public static   void RealMethod(string message) { ... } 
  public delegate void Del(string message);  // needed by C# 1.0 only
                       Del handler = RealMethod  ; // Instantiate the delegate.
                           handler("Hello World"); // Call the delegate.

Alt 2: // C# 2.0+ Anonymous function.
  Del del3 = delegate(string name) { ... }; 

Alt 3: // C# 3.0+ Lambdas
  Del del4 = name =>  { ...name... };      

- Del(egate): type representing references to methods with 
             a particular parameter list and return type. 

- When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance 
  with any method with a compatible signature and return type
  and invoke the method through the delegate instance.

- Used to pass methods as arguments to other methods.
  Ex: Event handlers are just methods invoked through delegates.

- Delegates can be chained together; for example, multiple methods
  can be called on a single event.

- anonymous methods (C# 2) and lambda expressions (C# 3) (in certain contexts)
  are compiled to delegate types.

MethodClass obj = new MethodClass();
Del d1 = obj.MethodOfClass1;
Del d2 = obj.MethodOfClass2;
Del d3 = ...;
Del allMethodsDelegate = d1 + d2 + d3;
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                
  - when invoked, all three methods are called in order.
    If the delegate uses reference parameters, they are 
    passed sequentially to each of the three methods in turn,
    and any changes by one method are visible to the next method.
  - When any of the methods throws an exception that is not
    caught within the method, that exception is passed to the
    caller of the delegate and no subsequent methods in 
    the invocation list are called.
  - returns the return value of last method invoked (d3).

    allMethodsDelegate -= d2; // remove from invocation list

int invocationCount = d1.GetInvocationList().GetLength(0);

- Although the delegate can use an out parameter, we do NOT
  recommend its use with multicast event delegates because 
  you cannot know which delegate will be called.

<span xsmall>Arrays</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/]
 Array Declaration:
 int[]    array1D = new int[5];
          array1Dº.Lengthº; // 5
 int[]    array1D = new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };

                  array3D.GetLength(1) *
                  array3D.GetLength(2)

- array properties:
  - Single-Dimensional, Multidimensional or Jagged.
  - Default values of numeric array elements are set to zero,
    and reference elements are set to null.
  - A jagged array is an array of arrays, and therefore its 
    elements are reference types and are initialized to null.

ºValue Type and Reference Type Arraysº
SomeType[] array4 = new SomeType[10];
                        ^^^^^^^^

<span xsmall>Walking Array</span>
<span xsmall>(IEnumerable/foreach)</span>
- Array type implements IEnumerable and IEnumerable<T> => ºforeachº available

- IEnumerable<T> interface has one method: GetEnumerator.

<span xsmall>Strings</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/strings/]
- string keyword is an alias for String.
- String objects are immutable:
  - All C# operators that appear to modify a string 
    actually return the results in a new string object.
- string: object of type String whose value is text.
- Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects.
- There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string => strings can 
  contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). 
- The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains,
  not the number of Unicode characters. 
- To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object.
- WARN: String can be initialized to null.
  - Use string.ºIsNullOrEmptyº(myStringVar)  to check emptyness
  - Concatenating an string to null will return the original string.

string alphabet = new string(new char[] { 'A', 'B', 'C' }); // Init from char[]
string path =  "c:\\Program Files\\MyDir;  // ← Regular string
string path = º@º"c:\Program Files\MyDir";   // ← @ == Verbatin
string template = @"My multiline Template 
    bla bla bla
    ble ble ble ,...";

ºString Escape Sequencesº
Escape    Character       Unicode
sequence  name            encoding
\'        Single quote    0x0027
\"        Double quote    0x0022

ºString Interpolationº C# 6.0+
- String interpolation achieves the same results as the String.Format method,
  but improves ease of use and inline clarity.
var jh = ( firstName: "Jupiter", lastName: "Hammon", born: 1711);
Console.WriteLine(º$º"º{jh.firstName}º </b>{jh.lastName</b>} was a poet born in º{jh.born}º."); //C6.0+
Console.WriteLine( "{0} {1} was an poet born in {2}.", pw.firstName, pw.lastName, pw.born);


                                                      Substrings
string s3 = "Visual C# Express";
System.Console.WriteLine(s3.Substring(7, 2));         // → "C#"
System.Console.WriteLine(s3.Replace("C#", "Basic"));  // → "Visual Basic Express"
int index = s3.IndexOf("C");                          //   (index value == 7 )
System.Console.WriteLine(s3[0]);                      // → "V"

ºStringBuilderº
- Modify individual chars "in-place" and then create a
  new string to store the results.
Ex:
string question = "hOW DOES mICROSOFT wORD DEAL WITH THE cAPS lOCK KEY?";
System.Text.StringBuilder ºsbº = new System.Text.StringBuilder(question);

for (int j = 0; j < ºsbº.Length; j++) {
    if (System.Char.IsLower(ºsbº[j]) == true)
        ºsbº[j] = System.Char.ToUpper(ºsbº[j]);
    else if (System.Char.IsUpper(ºsbº[j]) == true)
        ºsbº[j] = System.Char.ToLower(ºsbº[j]);
}
string corrected = ºsbº.ToString();
System.Console.WriteLine(corrected); // → How does Microsoft Word deal with the Caps Lock key?            

- Fast String Creation with StringBuilder.OºAppendº:

  System.Text.StringBuilder ºsbº = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
  // Create a string composed of numbers 0 - 9
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ºsbº.OºAppendº(i.ToString()); }
  System.Console.WriteLine(ºsbº);  // → 0123456789

<span xsmall>Indexers</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/]
- Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays.
- The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explicitly specifying a type 
  or instance member. 
- Indexers resemble properties except that their accessors take parameters.

  using System;
  
  class MyCollection<T> {
     private T[] arr = new T[100];
  // public T ºthis[int i]º {     // ← indexer def. C# <7

<span xsmall>Events</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/]
- special multicast delegate that can only be invoked from within the class
  that it is declared in.
- enable a class (publisher) to notify one or more classes(subscribers) when 
  something of interest occurs.
- Events have the following properties: 
- event handlers are invoked synchronously when an event is raised
  for each subscribed class.
  (see also Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously)

  Ex 1:
    private void Form1_Load(                        // ← Subscriber handler
            object sender, System.EventArgs e) {   
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        
        //                 Must match type of event                        
        // ...
    }
    publisher.myEventVar 
         += new System.EventHandler(this.Form1_Load);   // C# 1.0
         += this.Form1_Load;                            // C# 2.0+

  Ex 2:
    this.Click += (s,e) =˃ { MessageBox.Show(       ← Lambda expresion
       ((MouseEventArgs)e).Location.ToString());};  

  Ex 3:
   publisher.RaiseCustomEvent                       ← Anonymous method
     += delegate(object o, CustomEventArgs e)  {  
      string s = o.ToString() + " " + e.ToString();  
      Console.WriteLine(s);  
    };  

  publisher.RaiseCustomEvent -= HandleCustomEvent;  ← Unsubscribe  

º.NET Framework Guidelinesº
- All events in the .NET Framework class library are based
  on the EventHandler delegate:
  public delegate void EventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);  
  public delegate void EventHandler<TEventArgs>(object sender, EventArgs e); // FW 2.0

ºEx: Use Dictionary to Store Event Instancesº
BºWrapper Classº:

<span xsmall>Namespaces</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/]
- .NET Framework uses namespaces to organize its (many) classes.
- Developers use namespaces to control the scope of classes
- The global namespace is the "root" namespace: 
  ºglobal::System will always refer to the .NET System namespaceº

using System;  ← Use namespace System (Avoid System. repeated typing)
                 Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
                 Instead of:
                 System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

using Co = Company.Proj.Nested;  // ← Define namespace alias

                    Fully Qualified Names

ºnamespaceº N1        // N1
{
    class C1        // N1.C1
    {
        class C2    // N1.C1.C2
        {
        }
    }
    ºnamespaceº N2    // N1.N2

try {
      file = fileInfo.OpenWrite();
  } catch (DivideByZeroException e) {
      Console.WriteLine("Attempted divide by zero.");
  } catch (System.Exception e) {
      ..
  } finally {
      /*  Use finally-block to release (non-memory) resources
       *  (network/database connections, files, hardware resources).
       *  
       *  In an exception is raised, the finalizer is aborted
       *  and the base finalizer, if any, is called.
       */

      if (file != null) { file.Close(); }
  }

  
- ºSystem.Exceptionº: Parent class for all exceptions
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  If you catch System.Exception, rethrow it always at the end of
  the catch block.

  Do not throw next exceptions directly/intentionally from your code:
  - System.Exception
  - System.SystemException
  - System.NullReferenceException
  - System.IndexOutOfRangeException 

 -ºDo not catch an exception unless you can handle it and leaveº
  ºthe application in a known state.º
 
 - ºStackTraceº: 
  Exceptions contain a property named StackTrace.
  This string contains the name of the methods on the current call stack,
  together with the file name and line number where the exception was
  thrown for each method.
   - A StackTrace object is created automatically by the common language
     runtime (CLR) from the point of the throw statement, so that exceptions
     must be thrown from the point where the stack trace should begin.

- ºMessageº:
  - All exceptions contain a property named Message. This string should
   be set to explain the reason for the exception: 
   ºsecurity sensitive information must NOT be put hereº

- ºArgumentExceptionº:
  ArgumentException contains a property named ParamName that should be
  set to the name of the argument that caused the exception to be thrown.
  In the case of a property setter, ParamName should be set to value.


TODO: Do not create exceptions that can be thrown in debug mode but not 
     release mode. To identify run-time errors during the development phase, 
     use Debug Assert instead.

Defining Exception Classes:
- The derived classes should define at least four constructors:
  - one default constructor
  - one that sets the message property
  - one that sets both the Message and InnerException properties. 
  - The fourth constructor is used to serialize the exception.
 
[Serializable()]
public class InvalidDepartmentException : System.Exception {
    public    InvalidDepartmentException()               : base() { }
    public    InvalidDepartmentException(string message) : base(message) { }
    public    InvalidDepartmentException(
              string message,
              System.Exception inner)                 : base(message, inner) { }
    // A constructor is needed for serialization when an
    // exception propagates from a remoting server to the client. 
    protected InvalidDepartmentException(
              System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info,
              System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext context) :
              base(info, context) { }
}

-ºNew properties should only be added to the exception class whenº
 ºthe data they provide is useful to resolving the exception.º In this case
    ToString() should be overridden to return the added information.

ºCompiler-Generated Exceptionsº
(Automatically thrown by the CLR)
ArithmeticException         NullReferenceException
ArrayTypeMismatchException  OutOfMemoryException
DivideByZeroException       OverflowException
IndexOutOfRangeException    StackOverflowException
InvalidCastException        TypeInitializationException


- Some .NET languages, including C++/CLI, allow objects to throw exceptions
 that do not derive from Exception. Such exceptions are called non-CLS
 exceptions or non-Exceptions. You cannot throw non-CLS exceptions in C# 
 but you can catch them in two ways:
 - catch (ºRuntimeWrappedExceptionº e)
 - catch ()

<span xsmall>LINQ</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/]
- set of technologies to integrate query capabilities directly into the language:

  DATA SOURCE → LINQ Query Expression → Result
  ^^^^^^^^^^^
  SQL Database
  ADO .NET Datasets
  XML documents/streams
  dotNET collections

Ex: 
creating a data source, defining the query expression, and executing the query in a foreach statement.
C#

class LINQQueryExpressions {
  static void Main() {
    int[] BºdataSourceº = new int[]{97, ... };
  
    IEnumerable<int> OºscoreQuery = º
       Oºfrom score inº BºdataSourceº    // ← Query expresion
       Oºwhere score ˃ 80º
       Oºselect score;º

    Gºforeachº (int i in OºscoreQueryº) { // ← GºExecutionº
        Console.Write(i + " ");
    }
  }
}

- Some query operations (Count, Max, ..) have no equivalent query expression clause 
- Query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates,
  depending on the type that the query is applied to.
- IEnumerable<T> queries are compiled to delegates.
- IQueryable and IQueryable<T> queries are compiled to expression trees.

Ex 1: 
FARO SHUFFLE:
⏵ split a card deck exactly in half
⏵ then "shuffle" to interleave each one card 
  from each half to rebuild the original deck.

// Program.cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

LINQ CARD DECK CREATION: 
- create two sequences to represent suites and ranks, respectively.

 You'll create a really simple pair of iterator methods that will generate the ranks and suits as IEnumerable<T>s of strings:
C#

static IEnumerable<string> Suits() { ← Create sequence representing suites
    yield return "clubs" ; yield return "diamonds";
    yield return "hearts"; yield return "spades";
}

static IEnumerable<string> Ranks() { ← Create sequence representing ranks
    yield return "two"  ; yield return "three"; yield return "four" ;
    yield return "five" ; yield return "six"  ; yield return "seven";
    yield return "eight"; yield return "nine" ; yield return "ten"  ;
    yield return "jack" ; yield return "queen"; yield return "king" ;
    yield return "ace"  ;
}
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     compiler builds an object that implements IEnumerable<T>
     and generates the sequence of strings as they are requested.

static void Main(string[] args) { 
  var startingDeck = from s in Suits()
                     from r in Ranks()
                     select new { Suit = s, Rank = r }
                     .ToArray(); // Cache result into memory

  // Alt 2: 
  // var startingDeck = Suits().SelectMany(
  //     suit => Ranks().Select(
  //        rank => new { Suit = suit, Rank = rank }
  //     )
  // );
  foreach (var card in startingDeck) {
      Console.WriteLine(card);
  }

  var times = 0;
  shuffle = startingDeck;
  do { // (After 8 shuffles deck returns to startingDeck)
    var top    = startingDeck.Take(26);  ← Split into top/bottom
    var bottom = startingDeck.Skip(26);
    var shuffle = top.InterleaveSequenceWith(bottom)  // * 1
                  .ToArray(); // Cache into memory

    foreach (var card in shuffle) { Console.WriteLine(card); }
    Console.WriteLine();
    times++;
  } while (!startingDeck.SequenceEquals(shuffle));

  Console.WriteLine(times);
}

*1 Extensions.cs:
   using System;

   namespace LinqFaroShuffle {

<span xsmall>Async</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/]
- async : used to declare an asynchronous function, which returns a Task.
          - All async methods must contain at least one "await" expression:
          - await tells C# to take referred code and run it in a separate
            thread than the user thread.

Next table breaks down the asynchronous parts of the language.
  STATEMENT          DESCRIPTION
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |async              funct. modifier (interpreted at compile time)     |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |await              Operator suspending execution of the containing   |
 |                   method/thread until the awaited task completes.   |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |Task               Represents an asynchronous operation.             |
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |Task<TResult>      Represents an asynchronous operation return value.|
 |---------------------------------------------------------------------|
 |Task.ContinueWith  A continuation that is started after the operation|
 |                   in the Task is completed.                         |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
ºAsync Methodsº
- async/await: allows to invoke async-methods without explicit callbacks
               and no-need to split the code across multiple methods (or lambdas)

- When control reaches an await expression in the async method,
  control returns to the caller, and progress in the method is suspended until the
  awaited task completes. 
  When the task is complete, execution can resume in the method.

- async methods can have a return type of:
  - Task<TResult>:
  - Task         :
  - void         :  primarily used to define event handlers
                    methods returning void can NOT be awaited,
                    and its caller can NOT catch exceptions.

- async methods can NOT declare any reference or out parameters, 

DelayAsync has a return statement that returns an integer. 
Therefore the method declaration of DelayAsync must have a return type of Task<int>.

private ºasync voidº onClick(...) {
    Oºawaitº DoSomethingAsync();
}

private ºasync Taskº DoSomethingAsync()
{
    // alt 1:
    Task˂int˃ asyncTask = BºDelayAsyncTaskº(); //          ← Task˂int˃ is a "future" value.
    int result = Oºawaitº asyncTask;                             - to wait and fetch it real int value
                                                             Oºawaitº asyncTask is needed.
                                                             Calling Oºawaitº will move
                                                             thread execution ("code pointer") anywhere
                                                             else and return back to this code once the
                                                             result is available.
    
    // alt 2: (= alt 1 "compressed")
    // int result = Oºawaitº BºDelayAsyncTaskº();

    Debug.WriteLine("Result: " + result);
}

private ºasync Task˂int˃º BºDelayAsyncTaskº()
{
    Oºawaitº Task.Delay(100);
    return 5;
}

ºAsync improves responsivenessº

ºTrace an async programº

The numbers in the diagram correspond to the following steps.

    An event handler calls and awaits the AccessTheWebAsync async method.

    AccessTheWebAsync creates an HttpClient instance and calls the GetStringAsync asynchronous method to download the contents of a website as a string.

    Something happens in GetStringAsync that suspends its progress. Perhaps it must wait for a website to download or some other blocking activity. To avoid blocking resources, GetStringAsync yields control to its caller, AccessTheWebAsync.

    GetStringAsync returns a Task<TResult> where TResult is a string, and AccessTheWebAsync assigns the task to the getStringTask variable. The task represents the ongoing process for the call to GetStringAsync, with a commitment to produce an actual string value when the work is complete.

    Because getStringTask hasn't been awaited yet, AccessTheWebAsync can continue with other work that doesn't depend on the final result from GetStringAsync. That work is represented by a call to the synchronous method DoIndependentWork.

    DoIndependentWork is a synchronous method that does its work and returns to its caller.

    AccessTheWebAsync has run out of work that it can do without a result from getStringTask. AccessTheWebAsync next wants to calculate and return the length of the downloaded string, but the method can't calculate that value until the method has the string.

    Therefore, AccessTheWebAsync uses an await operator to suspend its progress and to yield control to the method that called AccessTheWebAsync. AccessTheWebAsync returns a Task<int> to the caller. The task represents a promise to produce an integer result that's the length of the downloaded string.

    Note

    If GetStringAsync (and therefore getStringTask) is complete before AccessTheWebAsync awaits it, control remains in AccessTheWebAsync. The expense of suspending and then returning to AccessTheWebAsync would be wasted if the called asynchronous process (getStringTask) has already completed and AccessTheWebSync doesn't have to wait for the final result.

    Inside the caller (the event handler in this example), the processing pattern continues. The caller might do other work that doesn't depend on the result from AccessTheWebAsync before awaiting that result, or the caller might await immediately. The event handler is waiting for AccessTheWebAsync, and AccessTheWebAsync is waiting for GetStringAsync.

    GetStringAsync completes and produces a string result. The string result isn't returned by the call to GetStringAsync in the way that you might expect. (Remember that the method already returned a task in step 3.) Instead, the string result is stored in the task that represents the completion of the method, getStringTask. The await operator retrieves the result from getStringTask. The assignment statement assigns the retrieved result to urlContents.

    When AccessTheWebAsync has the string result, the method can calculate the length of the string. Then the work of AccessTheWebAsync is also complete, and the waiting event handler can resume. In the full example at the end of the topic, you can confirm that the event handler retrieves and prints the value of the length result.
    If you are new to asynchronous programming, take a minute to consider the difference between synchronous and asynchronous behavior. A synchronous method returns when its work is complete (step 5), but an async method returns a task value when its work is suspended (steps 3 and 6). When the async method eventually completes its work, the task is marked as completed and the result, if any, is stored in the task.

For more information about control flow, see Control Flow in Async Programs (C#).
API async methods

You might be wondering where to find methods such as GetStringAsync that support async programming. The .NET Framework 4.5 or higher and .NET Core contain many members that work with async and await. You can recognize them by the "Async" suffix that’s appended to the member name, and by their return type of Task or Task<TResult>. For example, the System.IO.Stream class contains methods such as CopyToAsync, ReadAsync, and WriteAsync alongside the synchronous methods CopyTo, Read, and Write.

The Windows Runtime also contains many methods that you can use with async and await in Windows apps. For more information, see Threading and async programming for UWP development, and Asynchronous programming (Windows Store apps) and Quickstart: Calling asynchronous APIs in C# or Visual Basic if you use earlier versions of the Windows Runtime.
Threads

Async methods are intended to be non-blocking operations. An await expression in an async method doesn’t block the current thread while the awaited task is running. Instead, the expression signs up the rest of the method as a continuation and returns control to the caller of the async method.

The async and await keywords don't cause additional threads to be created. Async methods don't require multithreading because an async method doesn't run on its own thread. The method runs on the current synchronization context and uses time on the thread only when the method is active. You can use Task.Run to move CPU-bound work to a background thread, but a background thread doesn't help with a process that's just waiting for results to become available.

The async-based approach to asynchronous programming is preferable to existing approaches in almost every case. In particular, this approach is better than the BackgroundWorker class for I/O-bound operations because the code is simpler and you don't have to guard against race conditions. In combination with the Task.Run method, async programming is better than BackgroundWorker for CPU-bound operations because async programming separates the coordination details of running your code from the work that Task.Run transfers to the threadpool.
async and await

If you specify that a method is an async method by using the async modifier, you enable the following two capabilities.

    The marked async method can use await to designate suspension points. The await operator tells the compiler that the async method can't continue past that point until the awaited asynchronous process is complete. In the meantime, control returns to the caller of the async method.

    The suspension of an async method at an await expression doesn't constitute an exit from the method, and finally blocks don’t run.

    The marked async method can itself be awaited by methods that call it.

An async method typically contains one or more occurrences of an await operator, but the absence of await expressions doesn’t cause a compiler error. If an async method doesn’t use an await operator to mark a suspension point, the method executes as a synchronous method does, despite the async modifier. The compiler issues a warning for such methods.

async and await are contextual keywords. For more information and examples, see the following topics:

    async

    await

Return types and parameters

An async method typically returns a Task or a Task<TResult>. Inside an async method, an await operator is applied to a task that's returned from a call to another async method.

You specify Task<TResult> as the return type if the method contains a return statement that specifies an operand of type TResult.

You use Task as the return type if the method has no return statement or has a return statement that doesn't return an operand.

Starting with C# 7.0, you can also specify any other return type, provided that the type includes a GetAwaiter method. ValueTask<TResult> is an example of such a type. It is available in the System.Threading.Tasks.Extension NuGet package.

The following example shows how you declare and call a method that returns a Task<TResult> or a Task.
C#

// Signature specifies Task<TResult>  
async Task<int> GetTaskOfTResultAsync()  
{  
    int hours = 0;  
    await Task.Delay(0);  
    // Return statement specifies an integer result.  
    return hours;  
}  
  
// Calls to GetTaskOfTResultAsync  
Task<int> returnedTaskTResult = GetTaskOfTResultAsync();  
int intResult = await returnedTaskTResult;  
// or, in a single statement  
int intResult = await GetTaskOfTResultAsync();  
  
// Signature specifies Task  
async Task GetTaskAsync()  
{  
    await Task.Delay(0);  
    // The method has no return statement.    
}  
  
// Calls to GetTaskAsync  
Task returnedTask = GetTaskAsync();  
await returnedTask;  
// or, in a single statement  
await GetTaskAsync();  

Each returned task represents ongoing work. A task encapsulates information about the state of the asynchronous process and, eventually, either the final result from the process or the exception that the process raises if it doesn't succeed.

An async method can also have a void return type. This return type is used primarily to define event handlers, where a void return type is required. Async event handlers often serve as the starting point for async programs.

An async method that has a void return type can’t be awaited, and the caller of a void-returning method can't catch any exceptions that the method throws.

An async method can't declare in, ref or out parameters, but the method can call methods that have such parameters. Similarly, an async method can't return a value by reference, although it can call methods with ref return values.

For more information and examples, see Async Return Types (C#). For more information about how to catch exceptions in async methods, see try-catch.

Asynchronous APIs in Windows Runtime programming have one of the following return types, which are similar to tasks:

    IAsyncOperation<TResult>, which corresponds to Task<TResult>

    IAsyncAction, which corresponds to Task

    IAsyncActionWithProgress<TProgress>

    IAsyncOperationWithProgress<TResult, TProgress>

Naming convention

By convention, you append "Async" to the names of methods that have an async modifier.

You can ignore the convention where an event, base class, or interface contract suggests a different name. For example, you shouldn’t rename common event handlers, such as Button1_Click.

ºmodel scaffolding toolº:
- produces pages for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the movie model.
- Visual Studio -> Solution Explorer -> right-click the Controllers folder > Add > New Scaffolded Item.
- In the Add Scaffold dialog, select MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework > Add:
- Complete the Add Controller dialog:
  - Model class: Movie (MvcMovie.Models)
  - Data context class: Select the + icon and add the default MvcMovie.Models.MvcMovieContext
    (MvcMovieContext uses constructor-Dependency-Injection to inject the DDBB context)

- Add Data context
  - Views: Keep the default of each option checked
  - Controller name: Keep the default MoviesController
  - Select Add
- Add Controller dialog:
  - An Entity Framework Core database context class (Data/MvcMovieContext.cs)
  - A movies controller (Controllers/MoviesController.cs)
  - Razor view files for Create, Delete, Details, Edit, and Index pages (Views/Movies/*.cshtml)
- The automatic creation of the database context and CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) action methods and views is known as scaffolding.
  - When running next error will show up:
    | An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request.
    | 
    | SqlException: Cannot open database "MvcMovieContext-˂GUID removed˃" requested by the login. The login failed.
    | Login failed for user 'Rick'.
    | 
    | System.Data.SqlClient.SqlInternalConnectionTds..ctor(DbConnectionPoolIdentity identity, SqlConnectionString

- To fix it create the database using EF Core Migrations feature. 
- Migrations allows to create a database matching the data model and
  update the database schema when your data model changes.
- ºAdd Initial migration and update the ddbb with initial migrationº
  - Visual Studio -> Tools menu -> select NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console (PMC).
  - In the PMC, enter the following commands: console 
    |- Add-Migration Initial
    |  - The Add-Migration command generates code to create the initial database schema.
    |    DDBB schema is based on the model specified in the MvcMovieContext class 
    |  (in the Data/MvcMovieContext.cs file).
    |    The Initial argument is the migration name.
    |     Any name can be used, but by convention, a name that describes the migration is used.
    |    For more information, see Tutorial: Using the migrations feature
    |- Update-Database:
    |  - The Update-Database command runs the Up method in the Migrations/{time-stamp}_InitialCreate.cs
    |    file, which creates the database.
    |    Next error will be shown (ignore):
    |    - No type was specified for the decimal column 'Price' on entity type 'Movie'.
    |      This will cause values to be silently truncated if they do not fit in the default 
    |      precision and scale. Explicitly specify the SQL server column type that can accommodate all 
    |      the values using 'HasColumnType()'.
    |
  - The scaffolding tool automatically created a DB context and registered it with the DI container.

| public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
|     services.Configure˂CookiePolicyOptions˃(options =˃ {
|         // This lambda determines whether user consent for non-essential cookies 
|         // is needed for a given request.
|         options.CheckConsentNeeded = context =˃ true;
|         options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = SameSiteMode.None;

|   //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
|   //specifies the database to use and the connection string.
|       options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("MvcMovieContext")));
| }

- MvcMovieContext coordinates EF Core functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete, etc.) for the Movie model.
| using System;
| using System.Collections.Generic;
| using System.Linq;
| using System.Threading.Tasks;
| using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

|         public MvcMovieContext (DbContextOptions˂MvcMovieContext˃ options)
|         //                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                                              
|         //                     (ºappsettings.jsonº in dev)
|             : base(options) {
|         }
|         public DbSet˂MvcMovie.Models.Movie˃ Movie { get; set; }
|     }
| }

- Test the app:
    http://localhost:port/movies

ºStrongly typed models and the @model keywordº
- A controller can pass non-strongly typed ViewData to the view.
- MVC also provides strongly typed model objects.
 (used by the scaffolding)

// GET: Movies
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ Index() {
    return View(await 
        _context.Movie.ToListAsync());
}

Having validation rules automatically enforced by ASP.NET Core helps make your app more robust. It also ensures that you can't forget to validate something and inadvertently let bad data into the database.
Validation Error UI in MVC

Run the app and navigate to the Movies controller.

Tap the Create New link to add a new movie. Fill out the form with some invalid values. As soon as jQuery client side validation detects the error, it displays an error message.

Movie view form with multiple jQuery client side validation errors

Note

You may not be able to enter decimal commas in decimal fields. To support jQuery validation for non-English locales that use a comma (",") for a decimal point, and non US-English date formats, you must take steps to globalize your app. This GitHub issue 4076 for instructions on adding decimal comma.

Notice how the form has automatically rendered an appropriate validation error message in each field containing an invalid value. The errors are enforced both client-side (using JavaScript and jQuery) and server-side (in case a user has JavaScript disabled).

A significant benefit is that you didn't need to change a single line of code in the MoviesController class or in the Create.cshtml view in order to enable this validation UI. The controller and views you created earlier in this tutorial automatically picked up the validation rules that you specified by using validation attributes on the properties of the Movie model class. Test validation using the Edit action method, and the same validation is applied.

The form data isn't sent to the server until there are no client side validation errors. You can verify this by putting a break point in the HTTP Post method, by using the Fiddler tool , or the F12 Developer tools.
How validation works

You might wonder how the validation UI was generated without any updates to the code in the controller or views. The following code shows the two Create methods.
C#

// GET: Movies/Create
public IActionResult Create()
{
    return View();
}

// POST: Movies/Create
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ Create(
    [Bind("ID,Title,ReleaseDate,Genre,Price, Rating")] Movie movie)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        _context.Add(movie);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
    return View(movie);
}

The first (HTTP GET) Create action method displays the initial Create form. The second ([HttpPost]) version handles the form post. The second Create method (The [HttpPost] version) calls ModelState.IsValid to check whether the movie has any validation errors. Calling this method evaluates any validation attributes that have been applied to the object. If the object has validation errors, the Create method re-displays the form. If there are no errors, the method saves the new movie in the database. In our movie example, the form isn't posted to the server when there are validation errors detected on the client side; the second Create method is never called when there are client side validation errors. If you disable JavaScript in your browser, client validation is disabled and you can test the HTTP POST Create method ModelState.IsValid detecting any validation errors.

You can set a break point in the [HttpPost] Create method and verify the method is never called, client side validation won't submit the form data when validation errors are detected. If you disable JavaScript in your browser, then submit the form with errors, the break point will be hit. You still get full validation without JavaScript.

The following image shows how to disable JavaScript in the FireFox browser.

Firefox: On the Content tab of Options, uncheck the Enable Javascript check box.

The following image shows how to disable JavaScript in the Chrome browser.

Google Chrome: In the Javascript section of Content settings, select Do not allow any site to run JavaScript.

After you disable JavaScript, post invalid data and step through the debugger.

While debugging on a post of invalid data, Intellisense on ModelState.IsValid shows the value is false.

The portion of the Create.cshtml view template is shown in the following markup:
HTML


˂h4˃Movie˂/h4˃
˂hr /˃
˂div class="row"˃
    ˂div class="col-md-4"˃
        ˂form asp-action="Create"˃
            ˂div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly" class="text-danger"˃˂/div˃
            ˂div class="form-group"˃
                ˂label asp-for="Title" class="control-label"˃˂/label˃
                ˂input asp-for="Title" class="form-control" /˃
                ˂span asp-validation-for="Title" class="text-danger"˃˂/span˃
            ˂/div˃
       
        @ºMarkup removed for brevity.º@

The preceding markup is used by the action methods to display the initial form and to redisplay it in the event of an error.

The Input Tag Helper uses the DataAnnotations attributes and produces HTML attributes needed for jQuery Validation on the client side. The Validation Tag Helper displays validation errors. See Validation for more information.

What's really nice about this approach is that neither the controller nor the Create view template knows anything about the actual validation rules being enforced or about the specific error messages displayed. The validation rules and the error strings are specified only in the Movie class. These same validation rules are automatically applied to the Edit view and any other views templates you might create that edit your model.

When you need to change validation logic, you can do so in exactly one place by adding validation attributes to the model (in this example, the Movie class). You won't have to worry about different parts of the application being inconsistent with how the rules are enforced — all validation logic will be defined in one place and used everywhere. This keeps the code very clean, and makes it easy to maintain and evolve. And it means that you'll be fully honoring the DRY principle.
Using DataType Attributes

Open the Movie.cs file and examine the Movie class. The System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace provides formatting attributes in addition to the built-in set of validation attributes. We've already applied a DataType enumeration value to the release date and to the price fields. The following code shows the ReleaseDate and Price properties with the appropriate DataType attribute.
C#

[Display(Name = "Release Date")]
[DataType(DataType.Date)]
public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }

[Range(1, 100)]
[DataType(DataType.Currency)]
public decimal Price { get; set; }

The DataType attributes only provide hints for the view engine to format the data (and supplies elements/attributes such as ˂a˃ for URL's and ˂a href="mailto:EmailAddress.com"˃ for email. You can use the RegularExpression attribute to validate the format of the data. The DataType attribute is used to specify a data type that's more specific than the database intrinsic type, they're not validation attributes. In this case we only want to keep track of the date, not the time. The DataType Enumeration provides for many data types, such as Date, Time, PhoneNumber, Currency, EmailAddress and more. The DataType attribute can also enable the application to automatically provide type-specific features. For example, a mailto: link can be created for DataType.EmailAddress, and a date selector can be provided for DataType.Date in browsers that support HTML5. The DataType attributes emit HTML 5 data- (pronounced data dash) attributes that HTML 5 browsers can understand. The DataType attributes do not provide any validation.

DataType.Date doesn't specify the format of the date that's displayed. By default, the data field is displayed according to the default formats based on the server's CultureInfo.

The DisplayFormat attribute is used to explicitly specify the date format:
C#

[DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:yyyy-MM-dd}", ApplyFormatInEditMode = true)]
public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }

The ApplyFormatInEditMode setting specifies that the formatting should also be applied when the value is displayed in a text box for editing. (You might not want that for some fields — for example, for currency values, you probably don't want the currency symbol in the text box for editing.)

You can use the DisplayFormat attribute by itself, but it's generally a good idea to use the DataType attribute. The DataType attribute conveys the semantics of the data as opposed to how to render it on a screen, and provides the following benefits that you don't get with DisplayFormat:

    The browser can enable HTML5 features (for example to show a calendar control, the locale-appropriate currency symbol, email links, etc.)

    By default, the browser will render data using the correct format based on your locale.

    The DataType attribute can enable MVC to choose the right field template to render the data (the DisplayFormat if used by itself uses the string template).

Note

jQuery validation doesn't work with the Range attribute and DateTime. For example, the following code will always display a client side validation error, even when the date is in the specified range:

[Range(typeof(DateTime), "1/1/1966", "1/1/2020")]

You will need to disable jQuery date validation to use the Range attribute with DateTime. It's generally not a good practice to compile hard dates in your models, so using the Range attribute and DateTime is discouraged.

The following code shows combining attributes on one line:
C#

public class Movie
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [StringLength(60, MinimumLength = 3)]
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Release Date"), DataType(DataType.Date)]
    public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }

    [RegularExpression(@"^[A-Z]+[a-zA-Z""'\s-]*$"), Required, StringLength(30)]
    public string Genre { get; set; }

    [Range(1, 100), DataType(DataType.Currency)]
    [Column(TypeName = "decimal(18, 2)")]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    [RegularExpression(@"^[A-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9""'\s-]*$"), StringLength(5)]
    public string Rating { get; set; }
}

Open the Movie controller and examine the Details method:
C#

// GET: Movies/Details/5
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ Details(int? id)
{
    if (id == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    var movie = await _context.Movie
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.Id == id);
    if (movie == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    return View(movie);
}

The MVC scaffolding engine that created this action method adds a comment showing an HTTP request that invokes the method. In this case it's a GET request with three URL segments, the Movies controller, the Details method, and an id value. Recall these segments are defined in Startup.cs.
C#

app.UseMvc(routes =>
{
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "default",
        template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
});

EF makes it easy to search for data using the FirstOrDefaultAsync method. An important security feature built into the method is that the code verifies that the search method has found a movie before it tries to do anything with it. For example, a hacker could introduce errors into the site by changing the URL created by the links from http://localhost:xxxx/Movies/Details/1 to something like http://localhost:xxxx/Movies/Details/12345 (or some other value that doesn't represent an actual movie). If you didn't check for a null movie, the app would throw an exception.

Examine the Delete and DeleteConfirmed methods.
C#

// GET: Movies/Delete/5
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ Delete(int? id)
{
    if (id == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    var movie = await _context.Movie
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.Id == id);
    if (movie == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    return View(movie);
}

// POST: Movies/Delete/5
[HttpPost, ActionName("Delete")]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ DeleteConfirmed(int id)
{
    var movie = await _context.Movie.FindAsync(id);
    _context.Movie.Remove(movie);
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
}

Note that the HTTP GET Delete method doesn't delete the specified movie, it returns a view of the movie where you can submit (HttpPost) the deletion. Performing a delete operation in response to a GET request (or for that matter, performing an edit operation, create operation, or any other operation that changes data) opens up a security hole.

The [HttpPost] method that deletes the data is named DeleteConfirmed to give the HTTP POST method a unique signature or name. The two method signatures are shown below:
C#

// GET: Movies/Delete/5
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ Delete(int? id)
{

C#

// POST: Movies/Delete/5
[HttpPost, ActionName("Delete")]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ DeleteConfirmed(int id)
{

The common language runtime (CLR) requires overloaded methods to have a unique parameter signature (same method name but different list of parameters). However, here you need two Delete methods -- one for GET and one for POST -- that both have the same parameter signature. (They both need to accept a single integer as a parameter.)

There are two approaches to this problem, one is to give the methods different names. That's what the scaffolding mechanism did in the preceding example. However, this introduces a small problem: ASP.NET maps segments of a URL to action methods by name, and if you rename a method, routing normally wouldn't be able to find that method. The solution is what you see in the example, which is to add the ActionName("Delete") attribute to the DeleteConfirmed method. That attribute performs mapping for the routing system so that a URL that includes /Delete/ for a POST request will find the DeleteConfirmed method.

Another common work around for methods that have identical names and signatures is to artificially change the signature of the POST method to include an extra (unused) parameter. That's what we did in a previous post when we added the notUsed parameter. You could do the same thing here for the [HttpPost] Delete method:
C#

// POST: Movies/Delete/6
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task˂IActionResult˃ Delete(int id, bool notUsed)

@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/index?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=windows#host]
An ASP.NET Core app builds a host object on startup,
encapsulating all of the app's resources, such as:
- An HTTP server implementation
- Middleware components
- Logging
- DI
- Configuration

<span xsmall>Configuration</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/index?view=aspnetcore-2.2]
Configuration in ASP.NET Core

- key-value established by configuration providers
- Configuration providers read configuration data from:
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Command-line arguments  Ex: dotnet run Key1=value1 --CommandLineKey2=value2 /CommandLineKey3=value3
                                dotnet run --Key1 value1 /CommandLineKey2 value2
                                dotnet run CommandLineKey1= CommandLineKey2=value2
  - Custom providers (installed or created)
  - Directory files
  - Environment variables  (ASPNETCORE_* urls Logging ENVIRONMENT contentRoot AllowedHosts applicationName CommandLine)
  - In-memory .NET objects
  - Settings files

ºHost Configº
- Host configuration key-value pairs become part of the app's global configuration. 
- CreateDefaultBuilder provides default configuration for the app in the following order:
  - ASPNETCORE_ Env. variables 
    The ASPNETCORE_ prefix is stripped when the configuration key-value pairs are loaded.
  - Command-line arguments using the Command-line Configuration Provider.

- App configuration is provided from:
  - appsettings.json 
  - appsettings.{Environment}.json
  - Secret Manager when apps runs in the Development environment
  - Environment variables. Custom prefixes are stripped
  - Command-line arguments


ºHierarchical configuration dataº
   INPUT Config JSON       Translate to ":" separated config keys:
   {
     "section0": {
       "key0": "value",    section0:key0
       "key1": "value"     section0:key1
     },                    
     "section1": {         
       "key0": "value",    section1:key0
       "key1": "value"     section1:key1
     }
   }

   See also GetSection and GetChildren methods
   (Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration package) 

- File Configuration Providers have the ability to reload configuration 
  when an underlying settings file is changed after app startup.

ºKEY CONVENTIONSº
  - IConfiguration can be injected into a Razor Pages PageModel to obtain configuration for the class. Ex:
    public class IndexModel : PageModel {
        private readonly IConfiguration º_configº;
        public IndexModel(IConfiguration config) { _config = config; }
    }
    (not available to Config. providers as it's not available when they're set up by the host)
  
 - Keys are case-INsensitive.
 - If value for a key is set by different config.providers last one is used.
 - "__" is replaced by ":"
 - "--" is replaced by ":" in Azure Key Vault
 - ConfigurationBinder supports binding arrays to objects using array indices in configuration keys.

ºCONFIGURATION VALUES CONVENTIONS:º
 - Values are strings.
 - Null values can't be stored in configuration or bound to objects.

ºPROVIDERSº
(initialized in a new WebHostBuilder with CreateDefaultBuilder)
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Command-line Configuration Provider
  - Custom configuration provider
  - Environment Variables Configuration Provider
  - File Configuration Provider (INI, JSON, XML)
                                Ussually appsettings.json → appsettings.{Environment}.json
  - Key-per-file Configuration Provider
  - Memory Configuration Provider
  - User secrets (File in the user profile directory)

ºConfigureAppConfigurationº
(building the host)
- specify the app's configuration providers in addition to those added automatically by CreateDefaultBuilder:

public class Program {
    public static Dictionary<string, string> arrayDict = new Dictionary<string, string> {
      {"array:entries:0", "value0"},
      {"array:entries:1", "value1"},
      {"array:entries:2", "value2"},
    };

    public static void Main(string[] args) {
        CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
      WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, Oºconfig /* will be available to app's starup º/*) =>
        {
          Oºconfigº.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory());
          Oºconfigº.AddInMemoryCollection(arrayDict);
          Oºconfigº.AddJsonFile("json_array.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: false);
          Oºconfigº.AddJsonFile("starship.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: false);
          Oºconfigº.AddXmlFile("tvshow.xml", optional: false, reloadOnChange: false);
          Oºconfigº.AddEFConfiguration(options => options.UseInMemoryDatabase("InMemoryDb"));
          Oºconfigº.AddCommandLine(args);
        })
        .UseStartup<Startup>();
}



ºBind to an (POCO) object graphº


Bind is capable of binding an entire POCO object graph. 

Models/TvShow.cs:                              tvshow.xml:

public class TvShow {                          <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

- The Startup class is usually specified at build time by calling the
  WebHostBuilderExtensions.UseStartup<TStartup> method on the host builder:

  public class Program
  {
      public static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
      }
  
      public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
          WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
              .UseStartup<Startup>();
  }

  ººThe (IWeb)Host provides services that are available to the Startup 
  class constructor. 

- Once the Starup has executed, both the host and app services are
  available in ºConfigureº and throughout the app.

- A common use of dependency injection into the Startup class is to inject:
  - IHostingEnvironment to configure services by environment.
  - IConfiguration      to read configuration.
  - ILoggerFactory      to create a logger in Startup.ConfigureServices.

- alternatively use a conventions-based approach, using the appropriate Startup
  class at runtime.
  The class whose name suffix matches the current environment is prioritized:
  StartupDevelopment will be used if present over Startup class.
 For more information, see Use multiple environments.

 - For features that require substantial setup, there are Add{Service} extension
  methods on IServiceCollection.

  It gets created when your application starts up, and then it will construct
  all the necessary pieces, like the Kestrel web server, the application

  web host. It is the thing that constructs the web host but also configures
  all the necessay bits the web host needs to determine how to run the web 
  application.  
  - With ASP.NET Core 2, you will usually create a "default web host builder"
    which will already come with a lot defaults. For example, the default web
    host will set up the Kestrel web server, enable and configure logging,
    and add support for the appsettings.json configuration.

- BuildWebHost is part of the older convention before ASP.NET Core 2.1
  where the default pattern in the Program.cs was to build the web host 
  in a separate method. With 2.1, this was changed so that the method
  would no longer build the web host directly but just create the web 
  host builder (hence the method now being called CreateWebHostBuilder).
  to make the CreateWebHostBuilder reuseable. 
  For example, to reuse in integration testing using the TestHost.
 
- The default pattern in Program.cs (ASP.NET Core 2.1+) will be:

public class Program {
  public static void Main(string[] args) {
   ºCreateWebHostBuilder(args)º
   º  .Build()º
   º  .Run();º
  }

  public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =˃
      WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args) // default settings and config
          .UseStartup<Startup>();        // use 'Startup' class
}

<span xsmall>Sess+App.State</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/app-state?view=aspnetcore-2.2]
State can be stored using several approaches. 
   STORAGE APPROACH      STORAGE MECHANISM
   Cookies               HTTP cookies (may include data stored using server-side app code)
   Session state         HTTP cookies and server-side app code
   TempData              HTTP cookies or session state
   Query strings         HTTP query strings
   Form Hidden fields    HTTP form fields
   HttpContext.Items     Server-side app code
   Cache                 Server-side app code
   Dependency Injection  Server-side app code

ºCookiesº
 - store data across requests. 
 - sent with every request, size should be kept to a minimum.
   (unique session identifier,...)
 - Size and number restricted by HTTP clients.
 - must be validated by the app.
 - can be deleted by users and expire on clients.
 - Generally the most durable form of data persistence on the client.

ºSession state  (ASP.NET Core)º
 - Use a session ID cookie to keep a cache for the user session.
   (time between log-in and log-out)
 - The session cookie is encrypted via IDataProtector.
 - Not supported in SignalR apps since a SignalR Hub may execute 
   independent of an HTTP context.  For example,  when a long polling
   request is held open by a hub beyond the lifetime of the request's 
    HTTP context.
 - HttpContext.Session (ISession implementation) is available after
   session state is configured.
   SetInt32(ISession, String, Int32)     Get(ISession, String)
   SetString(ISession, String, String)   GetInt32(ISession, String)
                                         GetString(ISession, String)
   - Ex. Razon Page using session:
     @page
     @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http
     @model IndexModel
     public class IndexModel : PageModel {
         public const string OºSessionKeyNameº = "_Name";
         public string SessionInfo_Name { get; private set; }
         public void OnGet() {
           if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(HttpContext.ºSession.GetStringº(OºSessionKeyNameº))) {
               HttpContext.Session.SetString(OºSessionKeyNameº, "The Doctor");
           }
         }
     }
     
    - The in-memory cache provider stores session data in the memory of 
      the server where the app resides. In a server farm scenario:
      - Use sticky sessions to tie each session to a specific app instance
        on an individual server. 
      - Azure App Service uses Application Request Routing (ARR) to enforce
        sticky sessions by default. 
      - Sticky sessions can affect scalability and complicate web app updates.
        A better approach is to use a Redis or SQL Server distributed cache,
        which doesn't require sticky sessions. 
   
  - Configuration:
    - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session: (included in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App metapackage)
      provides middleware for managing session state. 
      To enable the session middleware, Startup must contain:
      - Any of the IDistributedCache memory caches.
      - The IDistributedCache implementation is used as a backing store for session.
      - A call to AddSession in ConfigureServices.
      - A call to UseSession in Configure.
    - Ex:
      public class Startup {
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
          services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
          services.AddSession(options => {
              options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10/* short timeout for easy testing */);
              options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
              options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
          });
          services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
        }
      
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env) {
          if (env.IsDevelopment()) { app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); }
          else {
              app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
              app.UseHsts();
          }
          app.UseHttpsRedirection();
          app.UseStaticFiles();
          app.UseSession();                      // ← Order of middleware is important.
          app.UseHttpContextItemsMiddleware();   //   InvalidOperationException exception occurs
          app.UseMvc();                          // ← when UseSession is invoked after UseMvc.
        }
      }
  - ºLoad session state asynchronouslyº
    - If LoadAsync isn't called first, the underlying session record is loaded synchronously.
    - Setup:
      - wrap DistributedSessionStore and DistributedSession implementations with 
        versions that throw an exception if the LoadAsync method isn't called before
        TryGetValue, Set, or Remove. Register the wrapped versions in the services container.

  - ºSession optionsº
    OPTION         DESCRIPTION
    Cookie         cookie settings.
                   (CookieName, Path, SameSite, HttpOnly, IsEssential)
    IdleTimeout    Default to 20 minutes.
    IOTimeout      max. amount of time allowed to load a session 
                   from the store or to commit it back to the store.
                   (only asynchronous operations).
                   Use InfiniteTimeSpan to disable. (1 minute by default).
<span TODO>TempData</span>
 - ASP.NET Core exposes the TempData property of a Razor Pages page model or TempData of an MVC controller.
 - This property stores data until it's read. 
 - The Keep and Peek methods can be used to examine the data without deletion.
 - TempData is particularly useful for redirection when data is required
   for more than a single request. TempData is implemented by TempData providers
   using either cookies or session state.

ºHttpContext.Itemsº collection
  - used to store data while processing a single request(discarded after response)
  - Items collection is often used to allow components or
    middleware to communicate when they operate at different points
    in time during a request and have no direct way to pass parameters.

  - Example: isVerified added to Items collection.
    app.Use(async (context, next) => {
        ...
        context.Items["isVerified"] = true;
        await next.Invoke();
    });
    Later in the pipeline:
    app.Run(async (context) => {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Verified: {context.Items["isVerified"]}");
    });
  
  - (See also how to use unique object keys to avoid key collisions among different apps).

ºCacheº
  - App can control the lifetime of cached items.
  - No associated with requests/users/sessions.
  - <a TODO href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/response?view=aspnetcore-2.2">Response Caching</a> 

ºDependency Injectionº
  - Use Dependency Injection to make data available to all users:
  - Ex:
    - SETUP-STEP 1: Define a service containing the data.
      public class MyAppData {
          // Declare properties and methods
      }
    - SETUP-STEP 2: Add the service class to Startup.ConfigureServices:
      public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
          services.AddSingleton<MyAppData>();
      }
    - USSAGE: Consume the data service class:
      public class IndexModel : PageModel {
          public IndexModel(MyAppData myService) {
              // Do something with the service
          }
      }
</pre>

<span xsmall>Troubleshooting</span>
Problem: """Unable to resolve service for type 
             'Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Distributed.IDistributedCache'
          while attempting to activate
             'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session.DistributedSessionStore'.
         """
Solution: This is usually caused by failing to configure at least one
          IDistributedCache implementation.

Problem: Session storage fails to store the session data.
Solution: The recommended approach to check for errors is to call await
          feature.Session.CommitAsync(); from app code when the app is
          done writing to the session. CommitAsync throws an exception if
          the backing store is unavailable.
           If CommitAsync fails, the app can process the exception. 
          LoadAsync throws under the same conditions where the data store is unavailable.

<span xsmall>Dependency Injection</span>
@[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2]
Dependency injection in ASP.net steps:
- STEP 1: use of an interface to define the dependency implementation.
          public interface IMyDependency {
              Task WriteMessage(string message);
          }
- STEP 2: Register the dependency in a service container in the app's
          Startup.ConfigureServices method.
          ASP.NET Core provides a built-in service container, IServiceProvider.
- STEP 3: Injection of the service into the constructor of the class 
          where it's used.
          ASP.net framework takes on the responsibility of creating an
          instance of the dependency and disposing of it when it's no longer needed.


public class MyDependencyImpl : IMyDependency {
    

    public Task WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation(
            "MyDependency.WriteMessage called. Message: {MESSAGE}", 
            message);

        return Task.FromResult(0);
    }
}

MyDependency requests an ILogger<TCategoryName> in its constructor. It's not unusual to use dependency injection in a chained fashion. Each requested dependency in turn requests its own dependencies. The container resolves the dependencies in the graph and returns the fully resolved service. The collective set of dependencies that must be resolved is typically referred to as a dependency tree, dependency graph, or object graph.

IMyDependency and ILogger<TCategoryName> must be registered in the service container. IMyDependency is registered in Startup.ConfigureServices. ILogger<TCategoryName> is registered by the logging abstractions infrastructure, so it's a framework-provided service registered by default by the framework.

The container resolves ILogger<TCategoryName> by taking advantage of (generic) open types, eliminating the need to register every (generic) constructed type:
C#

services.AddSingleton(typeof(ILogger<T>), typeof(Logger<T>));

In the sample app, the IMyDependency service is registered with the concrete type MyDependency. The registration scopes the service lifetime to the lifetime of a single request. Service lifetimes are described later in this topic.
C#

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
    services.AddTransient<IOperationTransient, Operation>();
    services.AddScoped<IOperationScoped, Operation>();
    services.AddSingleton<IOperationSingleton, Operation>();
    services.AddSingleton<IOperationSingletonInstance>(new Operation(Guid.Empty));

    // OperationService depends on each of the other Operation types.
    services.AddTransient<OperationService, OperationService>();
}

Note

Each services.Add{SERVICE_NAME} extension method adds (and potentially configures) services. For example, services.AddMvc() adds the services Razor Pages and MVC require. We recommended that apps follow this convention. Place extension methods in the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection namespace to encapsulate groups of service registrations.

If the service's constructor requires a built in type, such as a string, the type can be injected by using configuration or the options pattern:
C#

public class MyDependency : IMyDependency
{
    public MyDependency(IConfiguration config)
    {
        var myStringValue = config["MyStringKey"];

        // Use myStringValue
    }

    ...
}

An instance of the service is requested via the constructor of a class where the service is used and assigned to a private field. The field is used to access the service as necessary throughout the class.

In the sample app, the IMyDependency instance is requested and used to call the service's WriteMessage method:
C#

public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly IMyDependency _myDependency;

    public IndexModel(
        IMyDependency myDependency, 
        OperationService operationService,
        IOperationTransient transientOperation,
        IOperationScoped scopedOperation,
        IOperationSingleton singletonOperation,
        IOperationSingletonInstance singletonInstanceOperation)
    {
        _myDependency = myDependency;
        OperationService = operationService;
        TransientOperation = transientOperation;
        ScopedOperation = scopedOperation;
        SingletonOperation = singletonOperation;
        SingletonInstanceOperation = singletonInstanceOperation;
    }

    public OperationService OperationService { get; }
    public IOperationTransient TransientOperation { get; }
    public IOperationScoped ScopedOperation { get; }
    public IOperationSingleton SingletonOperation { get; }
    public IOperationSingletonInstance SingletonInstanceOperation { get; }

    public async Task OnGetAsync()
    {
        await _myDependency.WriteMessage(
            "IndexModel.OnGetAsync created this message.");
    }
}

Framework-provided services

The Startup.ConfigureServices method is responsible for defining the services the app uses, including platform features, such as Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core MVC. Initially, the IServiceCollection provided to ConfigureServices has the following services defined (depending on how the host was configured):
Service Type    Lifetime
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Builder.IApplicationBuilderFactory     Transient
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IApplicationLifetime   Singleton
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment    Singleton
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartup   Singleton
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter     Transient
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.IServer     Singleton
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IHttpContextFactory   Transient
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger<T>     Singleton
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory     Singleton
Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool.ObjectPoolProvider  Singleton
Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IConfigureOptions<T>   Transient
Microsoft.Extensions.Options.IOptions<T>    Singleton
System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource     Singleton
System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticListener   Singleton

When a service collection extension method is available to register a service (and its dependent services, if required), the convention is to use a single Add{SERVICE_NAME} extension method to register all of the services required by that service. The following code is an example of how to add additional services to the container using the extension methods AddDbContext, AddIdentity, and AddMvc:
C#

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

    services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
        .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

    services.AddMvc();
}

For more information, see the ServiceCollection Class in the API documentation.
Service lifetimes

Choose an appropriate lifetime for each registered service. ASP.NET Core services can be configured with the following lifetimes:

Transient

Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested from the service container. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.

Scoped

Scoped lifetime services are created once per client request (connection).

Warning

When using a scoped service in a middleware, inject the service into the Invoke or InvokeAsync method. Don't inject via constructor injection because it forces the service to behave like a singleton. For more information, see ASP.NET Core Middleware.

Singleton

Singleton lifetime services are created the first time they're requested (or when ConfigureServices is run and an instance is specified with the service registration). Every subsequent request uses the same instance. If the app requires singleton behavior, allowing the service container to manage the service's lifetime is recommended. Don't implement the singleton design pattern and provide user code to manage the object's lifetime in the class.

Warning

It's dangerous to resolve a scoped service from a singleton. It may cause the service to have incorrect state when processing subsequent requests.
Constructor injection behavior

Services can be resolved by two mechanisms:

    IServiceProvider
    ActivatorUtilities – Permits object creation without service registration in the dependency injection container. ActivatorUtilities is used with user-facing abstractions, such as Tag Helpers, MVC controllers, and model binders.

Constructors can accept arguments that aren't provided by dependency injection, but the arguments must assign default values.

When services are resolved by IServiceProvider or ActivatorUtilities, constructor injection requires a public constructor.

When services are resolved by ActivatorUtilities, constructor injection requires that only one applicable constructor exists. Constructor overloads are supported, but only one overload can exist whose arguments can all be fulfilled by dependency injection.
Entity Framework contexts

Entity Framework contexts are usually added to the service container using the scoped lifetime because web app database operations are normally scoped to the client request. The default lifetime is scoped if a lifetime isn't specified by an AddDbContext<TContext> overload when registering the database context. Services of a given lifetime shouldn't use a database context with a shorter lifetime than the service.
Lifetime and registration options

To demonstrate the difference between the lifetime and registration options, consider the following interfaces that represent tasks as an operation with a unique identifier, OperationId. Depending on how the lifetime of an operations service is configured for the following interfaces, the container provides either the same or a different instance of the service when requested by a class:
C#

public interface IOperation
{
    Guid OperationId { get; }
}

public interface IOperationTransient : IOperation
{
}

public interface IOperationScoped : IOperation
{
}

public interface IOperationSingleton : IOperation
{
}

public interface IOperationSingletonInstance : IOperation
{
}

The interfaces are implemented in the Operation class. The Operation constructor generates a GUID if one isn't supplied:
C#

public class Operation : IOperationTransient, 
    IOperationScoped, 
    IOperationSingleton, 
    IOperationSingletonInstance
{
    public Operation() : this(Guid.NewGuid())
    {
    }

    public Operation(Guid id)
    {
        OperationId = id;
    }

    public Guid OperationId { get; private set; }
}

An OperationService is registered that depends on each of the other Operation types. When OperationService is requested via dependency injection, it receives either a new instance of each service or an existing instance based on the lifetime of the dependent service.

    When transient services are created when requested from the container, the OperationId of the IOperationTransient service is different than the OperationId of the OperationService. OperationService receives a new instance of the IOperationTransient class. The new instance yields a different OperationId.
    When scoped services are created per client request, the OperationId of the IOperationScoped service is the same as that of OperationService within a client request. Across client requests, both services share a different OperationId value.
    When singleton and singleton-instance services are created once and used across all client requests and all services, the OperationId is constant across all service requests.

C#

public class OperationService
{
    public OperationService(
        IOperationTransient transientOperation,
        IOperationScoped scopedOperation,
        IOperationSingleton singletonOperation,
        IOperationSingletonInstance instanceOperation)
    {
        TransientOperation = transientOperation;
        ScopedOperation = scopedOperation;
        SingletonOperation = singletonOperation;
        SingletonInstanceOperation = instanceOperation;
    }

    public IOperationTransient TransientOperation { get; }
    public IOperationScoped ScopedOperation { get; }
    public IOperationSingleton SingletonOperation { get; }
    public IOperationSingletonInstance SingletonInstanceOperation { get; }
}

In Startup.ConfigureServices, each type is added to the container according to its named lifetime:
C#

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
    services.AddTransient<IOperationTransient, Operation>();
    services.AddScoped<IOperationScoped, Operation>();
    services.AddSingleton<IOperationSingleton, Operation>();
    services.AddSingleton<IOperationSingletonInstance>(new Operation(Guid.Empty));

    // OperationService depends on each of the other Operation types.
    services.AddTransient<OperationService, OperationService>();
}

The IOperationSingletonInstance service is using a specific instance with a known ID of Guid.Empty. It's clear when this type is in use (its GUID is all zeroes).

The sample app demonstrates object lifetimes within and between individual requests. The sample app's IndexModel requests each kind of IOperation type and the OperationService. The page then displays all of the page model class's and service's OperationId values through property assignments:
C#

public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly IMyDependency _myDependency;

    public IndexModel(
        IMyDependency myDependency, 
        OperationService operationService,
        IOperationTransient transientOperation,
        IOperationScoped scopedOperation,
        IOperationSingleton singletonOperation,
        IOperationSingletonInstance singletonInstanceOperation)
    {
        _myDependency = myDependency;
        OperationService = operationService;
        TransientOperation = transientOperation;
        ScopedOperation = scopedOperation;
        SingletonOperation = singletonOperation;
        SingletonInstanceOperation = singletonInstanceOperation;
    }

    public OperationService OperationService { get; }
    public IOperationTransient TransientOperation { get; }
    public IOperationScoped ScopedOperation { get; }
    public IOperationSingleton SingletonOperation { get; }
    public IOperationSingletonInstance SingletonInstanceOperation { get; }

    public async Task OnGetAsync()
    {
        await _myDependency.WriteMessage(
            "IndexModel.OnGetAsync created this message.");
    }
}

Two following output shows the results of two requests:

First request:

Controller operations:

Transient: d233e165-f417-469b-a866-1cf1935d2518
Scoped: 5d997e2d-55f5-4a64-8388-51c4e3a1ad19
Singleton: 01271bc1-9e31-48e7-8f7c-7261b040ded9
Instance: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

OperationService operations:

Transient: c6b049eb-1318-4e31-90f1-eb2dd849ff64
Scoped: 5d997e2d-55f5-4a64-8388-51c4e3a1ad19
Singleton: 01271bc1-9e31-48e7-8f7c-7261b040ded9
Instance: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Second request:

Controller operations:

Transient: b63bd538-0a37-4ff1-90ba-081c5138dda0
Scoped: 31e820c5-4834-4d22-83fc-a60118acb9f4
Singleton: 01271bc1-9e31-48e7-8f7c-7261b040ded9
Instance: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

OperationService operations:

Transient: c4cbacb8-36a2-436d-81c8-8c1b78808aaf
Scoped: 31e820c5-4834-4d22-83fc-a60118acb9f4
Singleton: 01271bc1-9e31-48e7-8f7c-7261b040ded9
Instance: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Observe which of the OperationId values vary within a request and between requests:

    Transient objects are always different. The transient OperationId value for both the first and second client requests are different for both OperationService operations and across client requests. A new instance is provided to each service request and client request.
    Scoped objects are the same within a client request but different across client requests.
    Singleton objects are the same for every object and every request regardless of whether an Operation instance is provided in ConfigureServices.

Call services from main

Create an IServiceScope with IServiceScopeFactory.CreateScope to resolve a scoped service within the app's scope. This approach is useful to access a scoped service at startup to run initialization tasks. The following example shows how to obtain a context for the MyScopedService in Program.Main:
C#

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var host = CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build();

    using (var serviceScope = host.Services.CreateScope())
    {
        var services = serviceScope.ServiceProvider;

        try
        {
            var serviceContext = services.GetRequiredService<MyScopedService>();
            // Use the context here
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
            logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred.");
        }
    }

    host.Run();
}

Scope validation

When the app is running in the Development environment, the default service provider performs checks to verify that:

    Scoped services aren't directly or indirectly resolved from the root service provider.
    Scoped services aren't directly or indirectly injected into singletons.

The root service provider is created when BuildServiceProvider is called. The root service provider's lifetime corresponds to the app/server's lifetime when the provider starts with the app and is disposed when the app shuts down.

Scoped services are disposed by the container that created them. If a scoped service is created in the root container, the service's lifetime is effectively promoted to singleton because it's only disposed by the root container when app/server is shut down. Validating service scopes catches these situations when BuildServiceProvider is called.

For more information, see ASP.NET Core Web Host.
Request Services

The services available within an ASP.NET Core request from HttpContext are exposed through the HttpContext.RequestServices collection.

Request Services represent the services configured and requested as part of the app. When the objects specify dependencies, these are satisfied by the types found in RequestServices, not ApplicationServices.

Generally, the app shouldn't use these properties directly. Instead, request the types that classes require via class constructors and allow the framework inject the dependencies. This yields classes that are easier to test.

Note

Prefer requesting dependencies as constructor parameters to accessing the RequestServices collection.
Design services for dependency injection

Best practices are to:

    Design services to use dependency injection to obtain their dependencies.
    Avoid stateful, static method calls.
    Avoid direct instantiation of dependent classes within services. Direct instantiation couples the code to a particular implementation.
    Make app classes small, well-factored, and easily tested.

If a class seems to have too many injected dependencies, this is generally a sign that the class has too many responsibilities and is violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Attempt to refactor the class by moving some of its responsibilities into a new class. Keep in mind that Razor Pages page model classes and MVC controller classes should focus on UI concerns. Business rules and data access implementation details should be kept in classes appropriate to these separate concerns.
Disposal of services

The container calls Dispose for the IDisposable types it creates. If an instance is added to the container by user code, it isn't disposed automatically.
C#

// Services that implement IDisposable:
public class Service1 : IDisposable {}
public class Service2 : IDisposable {}
public class Service3 : IDisposable {}

public interface ISomeService {}
public class SomeServiceImplementation : ISomeService, IDisposable {}

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // The container creates the following instances and disposes them automatically:
    services.AddScoped<Service1>();
    services.AddSingleton<Service2>();
    services.AddSingleton<ISomeService>(sp => new SomeServiceImplementation());

    // The container doesn't create the following instances, so it doesn't dispose of
    // the instances automatically:
    services.AddSingleton<Service3>(new Service3());
    services.AddSingleton(new Service3());
}

Default service container replacement

The built-in service container is meant to serve the needs of the framework and most consumer apps. We recommend using the built-in container unless you need a specific feature that it doesn't support. Some of the features supported in 3rd party containers not found in the built-in container:

    Property injection
    Injection based on name
    Child containers
    Custom lifetime management
    Func<T> support for lazy initialization

See the Dependency Injection readme.md file for a list of some of the containers that support adapters.

The following sample replaces the built-in container with Autofac:

    Install the appropriate container package(s):
        Autofac
        Autofac.Extensions.DependencyInjection

    Configure the container in Startup.ConfigureServices and return an IServiceProvider:
    C# 

public IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();
    // Add other framework services

    // Add Autofac
    var containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();
    containerBuilder.RegisterModule<DefaultModule>();
    containerBuilder.Populate(services);
    var container = containerBuilder.Build();
    return new AutofacServiceProvider(container);
}

To use a 3rd party container, Startup.ConfigureServices must return IServiceProvider.

Configure Autofac in DefaultModule:
C#

    public class DefaultModule : Module
    {
        protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.RegisterType<CharacterRepository>().As<ICharacterRepository>();
        }
    }

At runtime, Autofac is used to resolve types and inject dependencies. To learn more about using Autofac with ASP.NET Core, see the Autofac documentation.
Thread safety

Create thread-safe singleton services. If a singleton service has a dependency on a transient service, the transient service may also require thread safety depending how it's used by the singleton.

The factory method of single service, such as the second argument to AddSingleton<TService>(IServiceCollection, Func<IServiceProvider,TService>), doesn't need to be thread-safe. Like a type (static) constructor, it's guaranteed to be called once by a single thread.
Recommendations

    async/await and Task based service resolution is not supported. C# does not support asynchronous constructors, therefore the recommended pattern is to use asynchronous methods after synchronously resolving the service.

    Avoid storing data and configuration directly in the service container. For example, a user's shopping cart shouldn't typically be added to the service container. Configuration should use the options pattern. Similarly, avoid "data holder" objects that only exist to allow access to some other object. It's better to request the actual item via DI.

    Avoid static access to services (for example, statically-typing IApplicationBuilder.ApplicationServices for use elsewhere).

    Avoid using the service locator pattern. For example, don't invoke GetService to obtain a service instance when you can use DI instead. Another service locator variation to avoid is injecting a factory that resolves dependencies at runtime. Both of these practices mix Inversion of Control strategies.

    Avoid static access to HttpContext (for example, IHttpContextAccessor.HttpContext).

Like all sets of recommendations, you may encounter situations where ignoring a recommendation is required. Exceptions are rare—mostly special cases within the framework itself.

DI is an alternative to static/global object access patterns. You may not be able to realize the benefits of DI if you mix it with static object access.

During the latest edition of DockerCon, Microsoft shared multiple 
improvements made in the .NET Core over the past year, all aimed at enhancing 
the experience of using .NET and Docker together.

All of the improvements focused on .NET Core 3.0. The most foundational 
change was the reduction of the memory the .NET Core runtime (CoreCLR) uses 
by default. The CoreCLR manages the execution of all .NET Core programs; the 
memory it uses by default is the amount of memory initially allocated when a .
NET program is executed. Lowering the default CoreCLR memory usage means 
increasing the container’s memory usage efficiency without changing the 
default .NET Core configuration.

ºIterators ("yield return")º
- Methods performing custom iteration over a collection.
- yield return return each element ºone at a timeº.
  - When returning, the current location in code is remembered. 
  - Execution is restarted from that location.
- ºCall to iterator method is done through the foreach statement.º
- return type :
  - IEnumerable
  - IEnumerable˂T˃
  - IEnumerator
  - IEnumerator˂T˃

- Local functions can be used in a similar way to handle exceptions outside
  of the asynchronous operation. Ordinarily, exceptions thrown in async method
  require that you examine the inner exceptions of an AggregateException. 
  Local functions allow your code to ºfail fastº and allow your exception to

ºStatic constructorsº
- initializes static members of the type. Static constructors are parameterless.
Static constructors have the following properties:
    A static constructor does not take access modifiers or have parameters.
    A static constructor is called automatically to initialize the class before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.
    A static constructor cannot be called directly.
    The user has no control on when the static constructor is executed in the program.
    A typical use of static constructors is when the class is using a log file and the constructor is used to write entries to this file.
    Static constructors are also useful when creating wrapper classes for unmanaged code, when the constructor can call the LoadLibrary method.
    If a static constructor throws an exception, the runtime will not invoke it a second time, and the type will remain uninitialized for the lifetime of the application domain in which your program is running.

</pre>
Architecture

- Visual Studio supports running multiple instances of the environment 
- The IDE provides three services:
 SVsSolution, which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions;
 SVsUIShell, which provides windowing and UI functionality (including tabs, toolbars, and tool windows);
 and SVsShell, which deals with registration of VSPackages. 

 The Visual Studio SDK also includes the Managed Package Framework (MPF), which is a set of managed wrappers around the COM-interfaces that allow the Packages to be written in any CLI compliant language.

Support for programming languages is added by using a specific VSPackage called a Language Service.

- A Source Control VSPackage can provide its own customised user interface. 
Ctrl + TAB:list all open tabs and to switch between them.

 - Object Browser: The Object Browser is a namespace and class library browser for Microsoft .NET. It can be used to browse the namespaces (which are arranged hierarchically) in managed assemblies. The hierarchy may or may not reflect the organization in the file system.
 - Solution Explorer: a solution is a set of code files and other resources that are used to build an application.
    The files in a solution are arranged hierarchically, which might or might not reflect the organization in
    the file system. The Solution Explorer is used to manage and browse the files in a solution.
- Team Explorer: Team Explorer is used to integrate the capabilities of Team Foundation Server, 
   the Revision Control System into the IDE (and the basis for Microsoft's CodePlex hosting environment for open
   source projects). In addition to source control it provides the ability to view and manage individual work items
   (including bugs, tasks and other documents) and to browse TFS statistics.
- It is included as part of a TFS install and is also available as a download for Visual Studio separately.
- Data Explorer: used to manage Microsoft SQL Server instances.
- It allows creation and alteration of database tables or create queries and stored procedures, 
- Server Explorer: used to manage database connections on an accessible computer.
- PreEmptive Protection-Dotfuscator Community Edition: obfuscates and hardens applications to help 
    secure trade secrets (IP), reduce piracy/counterfeiting, protect against tampering and unauthorized debugging.
- Text Generation Framework: text generation framework (T4) which enables to generate text files from
                  templates either in the IDE or via code.
ASP.NET Web Site Administration Tool: The ASP.NET Web Site Administration Tool allows for the configuration of
                  ASP.NET websites.
Visual Studio Tools for Office: 


Supported products
Microsoft Visual C++

Microsoft Visual C++ is Microsoft's implementation of the C and C++ compiler and associated languages-services and specific tools for integration with the Visual Studio IDE. It can compile either in C mode or C++ mode. For C, it follows the 1990 version of the ISO C standard with parts of C99 specification along with MS-specific additions in the form of libraries.[38] For C++, it follows the ANSI C++ specification along with a few C++11 features.[39] It also supports the C++/CLI specification to write managed code, as well as mixed-mode code (a mix of native and managed code). Microsoft positions Visual C++ for development in native code or in code that contains both native as well as managed components. Visual C++ supports COM as well as the MFC library. For MFC development, it provides a set of wizards for creating and customizing MFC boilerplate code, and creating GUI applications using MFC. Visual C++ can also use the Visual Studio forms designer to design UI graphically. Visual C++ can also be used with the Windows API. It also supports the use of intrinsic functions,[40] which are functions recognized by the compiler itself and not implemented as a library. Intrinsic functions are used to expose the SSE instruction set of modern CPUs. Visual C++ also includes the OpenMP (version 2.0) specification.[41]

Microsoft Visual C#

Microsoft Visual C#, Microsoft's implementation of the C# language, targets the .NET Framework, along with the language services that lets the Visual Studio IDE support C# projects. While the language services are a part of Visual Studio, the compiler is available separately as a part of the .NET Framework. The Visual C# 2008, 2010 and 2012 compilers support versions 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 of the C# language specifications, respectively. Visual C# supports the Visual Studio Class designer, Forms designer, and Data designer among others.[42]

Microsoft Visual Basic

Microsoft Visual Basic is Microsoft's implementation of the VB.NET language and associated tools and language services. It was introduced with Visual Studio .NET (2002). Microsoft has positioned Visual Basic for Rapid Application Development.[43] [44] Visual Basic can be used to author both console applications as well as GUI applications. Like Visual C#, Visual Basic also supports the Visual Studio Class designer, Forms designer, and Data designer among others. Like C#, the VB.NET compiler is also available as a part of .NET Framework, but the language services that let VB.NET projects be developed with Visual Studio, are available as a part of the latter.

Microsoft Visual Web Developer: Microsoft Visual Web Developer is used to create web sites, web applications and web services using ASP.NET. Either C# or VB.NET languages can be used. Visual Web Developer can use the Visual Studio Web Designer to graphically design web page layouts.
Team Foundation Server

Team Foundation Server is intended for collaborative software development projects and acts as the server-side backend providing source control, data collection, reporting, and project-tracking functionality. It also includes the Team Explorer, the client tool for TFS services, which is integrated inside Visual Studio Team System.
Previous products

Visual FoxPro

Visual FoxPro is a data-centric object-oriented and procedural programming language produced by Microsoft. It derives from FoxPro (originally known as FoxBASE) which was developed by Fox Software beginning in 1984. Visual FoxPro is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine, which extends FoxPro's xBase capabilities to support SQL queries and data manipulation. Visual FoxPro is a full-featured,[45] dynamic programming language that does not require the use of an additional general-purpose programming environment. In 2007, Visual FoxPro was discontinued after version 9 Service Pack 2. It was supported until 2015.[46]

Visual SourceSafe

Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is a source control software package oriented towards small software-development projects. The SourceSafe database is a multi-user, multi-process file-system database, using the Windows file system database primitives to provide locking and sharing support. All versions are multi-user, using SMB (file server) networking.[47] [48] [49] However, with Visual SourceSafe 2005, other client–server modes were added, Lan Booster and VSS Internet (which used HTTP/HTTPS). Visual SourceSafe 6.0 was available as a stand-alone product[50] and was included with Visual Studio 6.0, and other products such as Office Developer Edition. Visual SourceSafe 2005 was available as a stand-alone product and included with the 2005 Team Suite. Team Foundation Server has superseded VSS as Microsoft's recommended platform for source control.

Microsoft Visual J++/Microsoft Visual J#: Microsoft Visual J++ was Microsoft's implementation of the Java language (with Microsoft-specific extensions) and associated language services. It was discontinued as a result of litigation from Sun Microsystems, and the technology was recycled into Visual J#, Microsoft's Java compiler for .NET Framework. J# was available with Visual Studio 2005 (supported until 2015) but was discontinued in Visual Studio 2008.

Visual InterDev

Visual InterDev was used to create web applications using Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) technologies. It supports code completion and includes database server management tools. It has been replaced with Microsoft Visual Web Developer.
Editions

Microsoft Visual Studio is available in the following editions or SKUs:[51]
Community

The Community edition was announced on 12 November 2014, as a new free version similar in functionality to Visual Studio Professional. Prior to this date, the only free editions of Visual Studio were the feature-limited Express variants. Unlike the Express variants, Visual Studio Community supports multiple languages, and provides support for extensions. However, the license restricts use to individual developers or to teams developing open source projects. Visual Studio Community is oriented towards individual developers and small teams.[52] [53]
Professional

As of Visual Studio 2010, the Professional edition is the entry level commercial edition of Visual Studio. (Previously, a more feature restricted Standard edition was available.)[54] It provides an IDE for all supported development languages. MSDN support is available as MSDN Essentials or the full MSDN library depending on licensing. It supports XML and XSLT editing, and can create deployment packages that only use ClickOnce and MSI. It includes tools like Server Explorer and integration with Microsoft SQL Server also. Windows Mobile development support was included in Visual Studio 2005 Standard, however, with Visual Studio 2008, it is only available in Professional and higher editions. Windows Phone 7 development support was added to all editions in Visual Studio 2010. Development for Windows Mobile is no longer supported in Visual Studio 2010; it is superseded by Windows Phone 7.
Enterprise

In addition to the features provided by the Professional edition, the Enterprise edition provides a new set of software development, database development, collaboration, metrics, architecture, testing and reporting tools.
Test Professional

The Test Professional edition was introduced with Visual Studio 2010. Its focus is the dedicated tester role. It includes support for the management of test environments, the ability to start and report on tests and to connect to Team Foundation Server. It does not include support for development or authoring of tests.[51]
Express

See main article: article and Microsoft Visual Studio Express. Visual Studio Express is a stripped-down version of Visual Studio for students and hobbyists, first introduced with Visual Studio 2005 and discontinued with Visual Studio 2015. Originally, it consisted of several editions, each of which targeted a single programming language. Visual Studio Express 2005, 2008 and 2010 consisted of the following editions that could have been installed side-by-side:

    Visual Basic Express
    Visual C++ Express
    Visual C# Express
    Visual J# Express (2005 only)
    Visual Web Developer Express
    Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone (2010 only)

Visual Studio 2012, 2013 and 2015 consist of editions geared towards different platforms instead:

    Express for Web: focuses on developing web apps
    Express for Windows: focuses on developing Universal Windows Platform apps
    Express for Desktop: focuses on developing traditional apps for Windows, using Windows API
    Team Foundation Server Express: provides source control and application lifecycle management
    Express for Windows Phone (2012 only): focuses on software development for Windows Phone 7.5 and 8.0

Versions prior to 2013 Update 2 do not include support for plug-ins. x64 compilers are not included in the Visual Studio Express edition IDEs, but are available as part of a Windows Software Development Kit that can be installed separately.[55] After an initial announcement[56] that the Express 2012 release would be restricted to creating Windows 8 Metro-style apps, Microsoft responded to negative developer feedback by reversing that decision and announcing that desktop application development would also be supported.[57]
History

The first version of Visual Studio was Visual Studio 97.[58] Before that, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual FoxPro and Visual SourceSafe were sold as separate products.

97

Microsoft first released Visual Studio (codenamed Boston, for the city of the same name, thus beginning the VS codenames related to places)[68] in 1997, bundling many of its programming tools together for the first time. Visual Studio 97 came in two editions: Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise, the professional edition has three CDs, and the enterprise on four CDs. It included Visual J++ 1.1 for Java programming and introduced Visual InterDev for creating dynamically generated web sites using Active Server Pages. There was a single companion CD that contained the Microsoft Developer Network library.

Visual Studio 97 was Microsoft's first attempt at using the same development environment for multiple languages. Visual J++, InterDev, and the MSDN Library had all been using the same 'environment', called Developer Studio.[69]

Visual Studio was also sold as a bundle with the separate IDEs used for Visual C++, Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro.[15]
6.0 (1998)

The next version, version 6.0 (codenamed Aspen, after the ski resort in Colorado), was released in June 1998 and is the last version to run on the Windows 9x platform.[70] Each version of each language in part also settled to v6.0, including Visual J++ which was prior v1.1, and Visual InterDev at the 1st release. The v6 edition of Microsoft was the core environment for the next four releases to provide programmers with an integrated look-alike platform. This led Microsoft to transition the development on the platform independent .NET Framework.

Visual Studio 6.0 was the last version to include Visual J++,[71] [72] which Microsoft removed as part of a settlement with Sun Microsystems that required Microsoft Internet Explorer not to provide support for the Java virtual machine.

Visual Studio 6.0 came in two editions: Professional and Enterprise.[73] The Enterprise edition contained extra features not found in Professional edition, including:

    Application Performance Explorer
    Automation Manager
    Microsoft Visual Modeler
    RemAuto Connection Manager
    Visual Studio Analyzer

Visual Studio was also sold as a bundle with the separate IDEs used for Visual C++, Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro.[15]
.NET (2002)

Microsoft released Visual Studio .NET (VS.NET), codenamed Rainier (for Washington's Mount Rainier), in February 2002 (the beta version was released via Microsoft Developer Network in 2001). The biggest change was the introduction of a managed code development environment using the .NET Framework. Programs developed using .NET are not compiled to machine language (like C++ is, for example) but instead to a format called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) or Common Intermediate Language (CIL). When a CIL application executes, it is compiled while being executed into the appropriate machine language for the platform it is being executed on, thereby making code portable across several platforms. Programs compiled into CIL can be executed only on platforms which have an implementation of Common Language Infrastructure. It is possible to run CIL programs in Linux or Mac OS X using non-Microsoft .NET implementations like Mono and DotGNU.

This was the first version of Visual Studio to require an NT-based Windows platform.[74] The installer enforces this requirement.

Visual Studio .NET 2002 shipped in four editions: Academic, Professional, Enterprise Developer, and Enterprise Architect. Microsoft introduced C# (C-sharp), a new programming language, that targets .NET. It also introduced the successor to Visual J++ called Visual J#. Visual J# programs use Java's language-syntax. However, unlike Visual J++ programs, Visual J# programs can only target the .NET Framework, not the Java Virtual Machine that all other Java tools target.

Visual Basic changed drastically to fit the new framework, and the new version was called Visual Basic .NET. Microsoft also added extensions to C++, called Managed Extensions for C++, so .NET programs could be created in C++.

Visual Studio .NET can produce applications targeting Windows (using the Windows Forms part of the .NET Framework), the Web (using ASP.NET and Web Services) and, with an add-in, portable devices (using the .NET Compact Framework).

The Visual Studio .NET environment was rewritten to partially use .NET. All languages are versions of Visual Studio, it has a cleaner interface and greater cohesiveness. It is also more customizable with tool windows that automatically hide when not in use. While Visual FoxPro 7 started out as part of Visual Studio .NET 2002, and early VS betas allowed debugging inside VFP-based DLLs, it was removed before release to follow its own development track.

The internal version number of Visual Studio .NET 2002 is version 7.0. Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio .NET 2002 in March 2005.[75]
.NET 2003

In April 2003, Microsoft introduced a minor upgrade to Visual Studio .NET called Visual Studio .NET 2003, codenamed Everett (for the city of the same name). It includes an upgrade to the .NET Framework, version 1.1, and is the first release to support developing programs for mobile devices, using ASP.NET or the .NET Compact Framework. The Visual C++ compiler's standards-compliance improved, especially in the area of partial template specialization. Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 is a version of the same C++ compiler shipped with Visual Studio .NET 2003 without the IDE that Microsoft made freely available. it is no longer available and the Express Editions have superseded it. The internal version number of Visual Studio .NET 2003 is version 7.1 while the file format version is 8.0.

Visual Studio .NET 2003 shipped in four editions: Academic, Professional, Enterprise Developer, and Enterprise Architect. The Visual Studio .NET 2003 Enterprise Architect edition includes an implementation of Microsoft Visio 2002's modeling technologies, including tools for creating Unified Modeling Language-based visual representations of an application's architecture, and an object-role modeling (ORM) and logical database-modeling solution. "Enterprise Templates" were also introduced, to help larger development teams standardize coding styles and enforce policies around component usage and property settings.

Service Pack 1 was released 13 September 2006.[76]
2005

Visual Studio 2005, codenamed Whidbey (a reference to Whidbey Island in Puget Sound region), was released online in October 2005 and to retail stores a few weeks later. Microsoft removed the ".NET" moniker from Visual Studio 2005 (as well as every other product with .NET in its name), but it still primarily targets the .NET Framework, which was upgraded to version 2.0. It is the last version available for Windows 2000 and also the last version to be able to target Windows 98, Windows Me and Windows NT 4.0 for C++ applications.[77] [78]

Visual Studio 2005's internal version number is 8.0 while the file format version is 9.0.[79] Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2005 on 14 December 2006.[80] An additional update for Service Pack 1 that offers Windows Vista compatibility was made available on 3 June 2007.[81]

Visual Studio 2005 was upgraded to support all the new features introduced in .NET Framework 2.0, including generics and ASP.NET 2.0. The IntelliSense feature in Visual Studio was upgraded for generics and new project types were added to support ASP.NET web services. Visual Studio 2005 additionally introduces support for a new task-based build platform called Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) which employs a new XML-based project file format.[82] Visual Studio 2005 also includes a local web server, separate from IIS, that can host ASP.NET applications during development and testing. It also supports all SQL Server 2005 databases. Database designers were upgraded to support the ADO.NET 2.0, which is included with .NET Framework 2.0. C++ also got a similar upgrade with the addition of C++/CLI which is slated to replace the use of Managed C++.[83] Other new features of Visual Studio 2005 include the "Deployment Designer" which allows application designs to be validated before deployments, an improved environment for web publishing when combined with ASP.NET 2.0 and load testing to see application performance under various sorts of user loads. Starting with the 2005 edition, Visual Studio also added extensive 64-bit support. While the host development environment itself is only available as a 32-bit application, Visual C++ 2005 supports compiling for x86-64 (AMD64 and Intel 64) as well as IA-64 (Itanium).[84] The Platform SDK included 64-bit compilers and 64-bit versions of the libraries.

Microsoft also announced Visual Studio Tools for Applications as the successor to Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and VSA (Visual Studio for Applications). VSTA 1.0 was released to manufacturing along with Office 2007. It is included with Office 2007 and is also part of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK. VSTA consists of a customized IDE, based on the Visual Studio 2005 IDE, and a runtime that can be embedded in applications to expose its features via the .NET object model. Office 2007 applications continue to integrate with VBA, except for InfoPath 2007 which integrates with VSTA. Version 2.0 of VSTA (based on Visual Studio 2008) was released in April 2008.[85] It is significantly different from the first version, including features such as dynamic programming and support for WPF, WCF, WF, LINQ, and .NET 3.5 Framework.
2008

Visual Studio 2008,[86] and Visual Studio Team System 2008[87] [88] codenamed Orcas (a reference to Orcas Island, also an island in Puget Sound region, like Whidbey for the previous 2005 release), were released to MSDN subscribers on 19 November 2007 alongside .NET Framework 3.5. The source code for the Visual Studio 2008 IDE is available under a shared source license to some of Microsoft's partners and ISVs.[89] Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2008 on 11 August 2008.[90] The internal version number of Visual Studio 2008 is version 9.0 while the file format version is 10.0. Visual Studio 2008 is the last version to support targeting Windows 2000 for C++ applications.[91]

Visual Studio 2008 is focused on development of Windows Vista, 2007 Office system, and Web applications. For visual design, a new Windows Presentation Foundation visual designer and a new HTML/CSS editor influenced by Microsoft Expression Web are included. J# is not included. Visual Studio 2008 requires .NET 3.5 Framework and by default configures compiled assemblies to run on .NET Framework 3.5, but it also supports multi-targeting which lets the developers choose which version of the .NET Framework (out of 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, Silverlight CoreCLR or .NET Compact Framework) the assembly runs on. Visual Studio 2008 also includes new code analysis tools, including the new Code Metrics tool (only in Team Edition and Team Suite Edition).[92] For Visual C++, Visual Studio adds a new version of Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC 9.0) that adds support for the visual styles and UI controls introduced with Windows Vista.[93] For native and managed code interoperability, Visual C++ introduces the STL/CLR, which is a port of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms to managed code. STL/CLR defines STL-like containers, iterators and algorithms that work on C++/CLI managed objects.[94] [95]

Visual Studio 2008 features include an XAML-based designer (codenamed Cider), workflow designer, LINQ to SQL designer (for defining the type mappings and object encapsulation for SQL Server data), XSLT debugger, JavaScript Intellisense support, JavaScript Debugging support, support for UAC manifests, a concurrent build system, among others.[96] It ships with an enhanced set of UI widgets, both for Windows Forms and WPF. It also includes a multithreaded build engine (MSBuild) to compile multiple source files (and build the executable file) in a project across multiple threads simultaneously. It also includes support for compiling icon resources in PNG format, introduced in Windows Vista. An updated XML Schema designer was released separately some time after the release of Visual Studio 2008.[97]

Visual Studio Debugger includes features targeting easier debugging of multi-threaded applications. In debugging mode, in the Threads window, which lists all the threads, hovering over a thread displays the stack trace of that thread in tooltips.[98] The threads can directly be named and flagged for easier identification from that window itself.[99] In addition, in the code window, along with indicating the location of the currently executing instruction in the current thread, the currently executing instructions in other threads are also pointed out.[99] [100] The Visual Studio debugger supports integrated debugging of the .NET 3.5 Framework Base Class Library (BCL) which can dynamically download the BCL source code and debug symbols and allow stepping into the BCL source during debugging.[101] a limited subset of the BCL source is available, with more library support planned for later.
2010

On 12 April 2010, Microsoft released Visual Studio 2010, codenamed Dev10,[102] and .NET Framework 4.[103] [104]

The Visual Studio 2010 IDE was redesigned which, according to Microsoft, clears the UI organization and "reduces clutter and complexity." The new IDE better supports multiple document windows and floating tool windows, while offering better multi-monitor support. The IDE shell has been rewritten using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), whereas the internals have been redesigned using Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) that offers more extensibility points than previous versions of the IDE that enabled add-ins to modify the behavior of the IDE.[105]

The new multi-paradigm ML-variant F# forms part of Visual Studio 2010.[106]

Visual Studio 2010 comes with .NET Framework 4 and supports developing applications targeting Windows 7.[107] It supports IBM DB2 and Oracle databases, in addition to Microsoft SQL Server.[107] It has integrated support for developing Microsoft Silverlight applications, including an interactive designer.[107] Visual Studio 2010 offers several tools to make parallel programming simpler: in addition to the Parallel Extensions for the .NET Framework and the Parallel Patterns Library for native code, Visual Studio 2010 includes tools for debugging parallel applications. The new tools allow the visualization of parallel Tasks and their runtime stacks.[108] Tools for profiling parallel applications can be used for visualization of thread wait-times and thread migrations across processor cores.[109] Intel and Microsoft have jointly pledged support for a new Concurrency Runtime in Visual Studio 2010[110] and Intel has launched parallelism support in Parallel Studio as an add-on for Visual Studio.[111]

The Visual Studio 2010 code editor now highlights references; whenever a symbol is selected, all other usages of the symbol are highlighted.[112] It also offers a Quick Search feature to incrementally search across all symbols in C++, C# and VB.NET projects. Quick Search supports substring matches and camelCase searches.[112] The Call Hierarchy feature allows the developer to see all the methods that are called from a current method as well as the methods that call the current one.[112] IntelliSense in Visual Studio supports a consume-first mode which developers can opt into. In this mode, IntelliSense does not auto-complete identifiers; this allows the developer to use undefined identifiers (like variable or method names) and define those later. Visual Studio 2010 can also help in this by automatically defining them, if it can infer their types from usage.[112] Current versions of Visual Studio have a known bug which makes IntelliSense unusable for projects using pure C (not C++).[113]

Visual Studio 2010 features a new Help System replacing the MSDN Library viewer. The Help System is no longer based on Microsoft Help 2 and does not use Microsoft Document Explorer. Dynamic help containing links to related help topics based on where the developer was in the IDE has been removed in the shipping product,[114] but can be added back using a download from Microsoft.[115]

Visual Studio 2010 no longer supports development for Windows Mobile prior to Windows Phone 7. Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 was released in March 2011.[116]
Ultimate 2010

Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 replaces Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite.[117] It includes new modeling tools,[118] such as the Architecture Explorer, which graphically displays projects and classes and the relationships between them.[119] [120] It supports UML activity diagram, component diagram, (logical) class diagram, sequence diagram, and use case diagram.[120] Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes Test Impact Analysis which provides hints on which test cases are impacted by modifications to the source code, without actually running the test cases.[121] This speeds up testing by avoiding running unnecessary test cases.

Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace. Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack, IntelliTrace records all events, such as prior function calls, method parameters, events and exceptions. This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint was not set where the error occurred.[122] Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it, and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded. Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded, in effect, allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and resource usage. The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers. The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues, as well as to reproduce the issue.[123] Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the operating environment as well as the precise steps used to run the test. These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues.[124]
2012

The final build of Visual Studio 2012 was announced on 1 August 2012 and the official launch event was held on 12 September 2012.[125]

Unlike prior versions, Visual Studio 2012 cannot record and play macros and the macro editor has been removed.[126]

New features include support for WinRT and C++/CX (Component Extensions) and C++ AMP (GPGPU programming) Semantic Colorization.[127]

On 16 September 2011, a complete 'Developer Preview' of Visual Studio 11 was published on Microsoft's website. Visual Studio 11 Developer Preview requires Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, or later operating systems.[128] Versions of Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) and C runtime (CRT) included with this release cannot produce software that is compatible with Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 except by using native multi-targeting and foregoing the newest libraries, compilers, and headers.[129] However, on 15 June 2012, a blog post on the VC++ Team blog announced that based on customer feedback, Microsoft would re-introduce native support for Windows XP targets (though not for XP as a development platform) in a version of Visual C++ to be released later in the fall of 2012.[130] "Visual Studio 2012 Update 1" (Visual Studio 2012.1) was released in November 2012. This update added support for Windows XP targets and also added other new tools and features (e.g. improved diagnostics and testing support for Windows Store apps).[131]

On 24 August 2011, a blog post by Sumit Kumar, a Program Manager on the Visual C++ team, listed some of the features of the upcoming version of the Visual Studio C++ IDE:[132]

    Semantic colorization: Improved syntax coloring, various user-defined or default colors for C++ syntax such as macros, enumerations, typenames and functions.[132]
    Reference highlighting: Selection of a symbol highlights all of the references to that symbol within scope.[132]
    New Solution Explorer: The new Solution Explorer allows for visualization of class and file hierarchies within a solution/project. It can search for calls to functions and uses of classes.[132]
    Automatic display of IntelliSense list: IntelliSense is automatically displayed whilst typing code, as opposed to previous versions where it had to be explicitly invoked through use of certain operators (i.e. the scope operator (::)) or shortcut keys (Ctrl-Space or Ctrl-J).[132]
    Member list filtering: IntelliSense uses fuzzy logic to determine which functions/variables/types to display in the list.[132]
    Code snippets: Code snippets are included in IntelliSense to automatically generate relevant code based on the user's parameters, custom code snippets can be created.[132]

The source code of Visual Studio 2012 consists of approximately 50 million lines of code.[133]
Interface backlash

During Visual Studio 11 beta, Microsoft eliminated the use of color within tools except in cases where color is used for notification or status change purposes. However, the use of color was returned after feedback demanding more contrast, differentiation, clarity and "energy" in the user interface.[134] [135]

In Visual Studio 2012 RC, a major change to the interface is the use of all-caps menu bar, as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces, and to provide added structure to the top menu bar area.[136] The redesign was criticized for being hard to read, and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand out better.[137] Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro programs.[138] However, there exists a Windows Registry option to allow users to disable the all-caps interface.[139]
2013

The preview for Visual Studio 2013 was announced at the Build 2013 conference and made available on 26 June 2013.[140] The Visual Studio 2013 RC (Release Candidate) was made available to developers on MSDN on 9 September 2013.[141]

The final release of Visual Studio 2013 became available for download on 17 October 2013 along with .NET 4.5.1.[142] Visual Studio 2013 officially launched on 13 November 2013 at a virtual launch event keynoted by S. Somasegar and hosted on .[143] "Visual Studio 2013 Update 1" (Visual Studio 2013.1) was released on 20 January 2014.[144] Visual Studio 2013.1 is a targeted update that addresses some key areas of customer feedback.[145] "Visual Studio 2013 Update 2" (Visual Studio 2013.2) was released on 12 May 2014.[146] Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 was released on 4 August 2014. With this update, Visual Studio provides an option to disable the all-caps menus, which was introduced in VS2012.[147] "Visual Studio 2013 Update 4" (Visual Studio 2013.4) was released on 12 November 2014.[148] "Visual Studio 2013 Update 5" (Visual Studio 2013.5) was released on 20 July 2015.[149]
2015

Initially referred to as Visual Studio "14", the first Community Technology Preview (CTP) was released on 3 June 2014[150] and the Release Candidate was released on 29 April 2015; Visual Studio 2015 was officially announced as the final name on 12 November 2014.[151]

Visual Studio 2015 RTM was released on 20 July 2015.[152] Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 was released on 30 November 2015.[153] Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 was released on 30 March 2016.[154] Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 was released on 27 June 2016.[155]
2017

Initially referred to as Visual Studio "15", it was released on 7 March 2017.[156] The first Preview was released on 30 March 2016.[157] Visual Studio "15" Preview 2 was released 10 May 2016.[158] [159] Visual Studio "15" Preview 3 was released on 7 July 2016.[160] [161] Visual Studio "15" Preview 4 was released on 22 August 2016.[162] [163] Visual Studio "15" Preview 5 was released on 5 October 2016.[164]

, Visual Studio is making the Ethereum Solidity language available to developers.[165]

On 14 November 2016, for a brief period of time, Microsoft released a blog post revealing Visual Studio 2017 product name version alongside upcoming features.[166]

On 16 November 2016, "Visual Studio 2017" was announced as the final name,[167] and Visual Studio 2017 RC was released.[168]

On 7 March 2017, Visual Studio 2017 was released for general availability.[168]

On 14 March 2017, first fix was released for Visual Studio 2017 due to failures during installation or opening solutions in the first release.[168]

On 5 April 2017, Visual Studio 2017 15.1 was released and added support for targeting the .NET Framework 4.7.

Team Services

On 13 November 2013, Microsoft announced the release of a software as a service offering of Visual Studio on Microsoft Azure platform; at the time, Microsoft called it Visual Studio Online. Previously announced as Team Foundation Services, it expands over Team Foundation Server by making it available on the Internet and implementing a rolling release model.[175] [176] Customers could use Azure portal to subscribe to Visual Studio Online. Subscribers receive a hosted Git-compatible version control system, a load-testing service, a telemetry service and an in-browser code editor codenamed "Monaco".[177] During the developer event on 18 November 2015, Microsoft announced that the service name is changed to Visual Studio Team Services.[178]

Microsoft offers Basic, Professional, and Advanced subscription plans for Team Services. The Basic plan is free of charge for up to five users. Users with an MSDN subscription of Visual Studio can be added to a plan with no additional charge.[179]
Application Lifecycle Management

Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a collection of integrated software development tools developed by Microsoft. These tools currently consist of the IDE (Visual Studio 2015 Community and greater editions), server (Team Foundation Server), and cloud services (Visual Studio Team Services).[180] Visual Studio ALM supports team-based development and collaboration, Agile project management, DevOps, source control, packaging, continuous development, automated testing, release management, continuous delivery, and reporting tools for apps and services.[181]

In Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008, the brand was known as Microsoft Visual Studio Team System (VSTS). In October 2009, the Team System brand was renamed[118] [182] Visual Studio ALM with the Visual Studio 2010 (codenamed 'Rosario') release.[183]

Visual Studio Team Services debuted as Visual Studio Online in 2013 and was renamed in 2015.[184]
Visual Studio LightSwitch

Microsoft Visual Studio LightSwitch is an extension and framework specifically tailored for creating line-of-business applications built on existing .NET technologies and Microsoft platforms. The applications produced are architecturally 3-tier: the user interface runs on either Microsoft Silverlight or HTML 5 client,[185] or as a SharePoint 2013 app;[186] the logic and data-access tier is built on WCF Data Services and exposed as an OData feed hosted[187] in ASP.NET; and the primary data storage supports Microsoft SQL Server Express, Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Azure. LightSwitch also supports other data sources including Microsoft SharePoint, OData and WCF RIA Services.

LightSwitch includes graphical designers for designing entities and entity relationships, entity queries, and UI screens. Business logic may be written in either Visual Basic or Visual C#. LightSwitch is included with Visual Studio 2012 Professional and higher. Visual Studio 2015 is the last release of Visual Studio that includes the LightSwitch tooling.[188]

The user interface layer is now an optional component when deploying a LightSwitch solution, allowing a service-only deployment.[189]

The first version of Visual Studio LightSwitch, released 26 July 2011,[190] had many differences from the current release of LightSwitch. Notably the tool was purchased and installed as a stand-alone product. If Visual Studio 2010 Professional or higher was already installed on the machine, LightSwitch would integrate into that.[191] The second major difference was the middle tier was built and exposed using WCF RIA Services.

As of 14 October 2016, Microsoft no longer recommends LightSwitch for new application development.[192]

The ASP.NET application requires no modifications to the registry and has no special installation requirements for the host company on hosted sites.

The advantages of Xcopy deployment
An Xcopy-style file transfer simplifies the deployment and the maintenance of ASP.NET sites because you make no registry entries and because you register no components. The Microsoft .NET applications are self-describing, typically with no dependencies. With assembly versioning, you can even copy a new copy of a DLL that the application uses without stopping the Web server.

The differences between Xcopy deployment and Copy Project in Visual Studio .NET
Xcopy deployment does not require that you install any special software on the development computer or on the Web server. The Visual Studio .NET Copy Project method requires that you install Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE) on the remote server. Xcopy also permits you to replace only the most recently-edited files. You can either select the files manually to replace them, or you can use the /d switch on the Xcopy command to specify the date, as follows:
xcopy source [destination] /D:m-d-y

About Windows Compatibility Pack for .NET Core
https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/Windows-Compatibility-Pack/
The newly ported APIs are roughly divided into two categories: 
- Windows-only and cross platform. The Windows-only APIs include:
  (deeply linked to the Windows operating system
   with Linux equivalents fundamentally different in design)
  - Active directory
  - Cryptography
  - Event logs and performance counters
  - File system security
  - Named pipes
  - Registry Access
  - Windows Services

- cross-platform libraries include:
  - Caching
  - ConfigurationManager (i.e. processing legacy app.config/web.config files)
  - DatasetExtensions (used for database access without an ORM)
  - ODBC database access
  - System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager (MEF v1)
  - System.Drawing
  - System.IO.Packaging (used for interacting with MS Office style Zip files)
  - System.ServiceModel (i.e. WCF)

Key Takeaways
- The plugin framework is a NuGet package that allows you to 
  customise and extend a .NET application
- Plugins are loaded at runtime from a catalogue which can be a local 
  source or via NuGet. 
- Supports all the current .NET Core based applications, ranging from 
  Blazor to ASP.NET Core and to Console, WPF and Windows Forms.
- Plugin-based software architecture can help in the following 
  scenarios: adding new features to the application after the release, 
  splitting large systems into smaller parts, giving end users and 3rd 
  parties the ability to extend your application.
- Future development plans include tagging plugins to help support 
  multiple different types of plugin in the same application and 
  updating and unloading plugins on the fly.
