OpenDaylight Magnesium:
- open source Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller platform.

- platform comprised of multiple modular component project that users
  can choose to mix and match in different configurations as needed.

ºDeterministic Networking Comes to OpenDaylightº
- DetNet is a Deterministic Networking project which aims to provide a 
  very precise, deterministic set of networking characteristics 
  including guaranteed bandwidth and bounded latency. The need for 
  deterministic attributes in networking is critical for real-time 
  applications that need to be execute with the exact same attributes 
  every time.

  - The release notes for Magnesium state that DetNet includes a number 
    of Layer3 deterministic networking and Layer2 Time-Sensitive 
    Networking (TSN) techniques,

    "Architecturally, DetNet applications communicate with MD-SAL over 
    RESTCONF API and the southbound DetNet controller enables MD-SAL to 
    obtain topology information about DetNet bridges and to subsequently 
    configure them by using the NETCONF protocol," the notes state. "The 
    Magnesium release includes the first version of DetNet with time sync 
    support for TSN, topology discovery for DetNet bridges, the 
    southbound controller plugin, and features to manage the end-to-end 
    information flow and service configuration, QoS, and optimal path 
    calculation."
    
- Plastic Brings Translation by Intent to SDN
  "The model-to-model translation problem is pervasive in writing SDN 
  controller applications, both internally and in supporting 
  microservices," the release notes state. "Plastic emphasizes writing 
  translations intended to be as resilient to model changes as 
  possible."
