OPC:  OpenShift Container Platform
App:  (Application). In the context of OPC is the full set
      of processes/services used to have a functional application.
      For example an app can be:
        - 1 pod  running Postgresql
        - 3 pods running FrontEnd
        - 1 pod  running Cache
      In practice the App is described by the DeploymentConfig (dc/) 
      object created during the 'oc new-app' phase.
S2I: Source to Image: One of the possible Build Strategies
SDN: Software defined network

<span xsmall>API Objects "INPUTS&amp;OUTPUTS"</span>
API objects are designed such that there are portions of
the object which specify the desired state of the system,
and other portions which reflect the status or current
state of the system.
ºThis can be thought of as inputs and outputs.º
 The input portions, when expressed in JSON or YAML,
are items that fit naturally as source control managed
(SCM) artifacts. (App. configuration as code)

WARN: API object specifications should be captured with 
'oc export':
 This operation removes environment specific data from the
object definitions (e.g., current namespace or assigned
IP addresses), allowing them to be recreated in different
environments (unlike oc get operations, which output an
unfiltered state of the object).

Concepts and Types 
Kubernetes and OpenShift help developers and operators build, test, and deploy
applications in a containerized cloud environment. 
Applications may be composed of all of the components below, although most
developers will be concerned with Services, Deployments, and Builds for 
delivering changes. 

Concepts: 

* Containers:
    A definition of how to run one or more processes inside of a portable Linux
    environment. Containers are started from an Image and are usually isolated
    from other containers on the same machine.
    
* Image:
    A layered Linux filesystem that contains application code, dependencies,
    and any supporting operating system libraries. An image is identified by
    a name that can be local to the current cluster or point to a remote Docker
    registry (a storage server for images).
    
* Pods [pod]:
    A set of one or more containers that are deployed onto a Node together and
    share a unique IP and Volumes (persistent storage). Pods also define the
    security and runtime policy for each container.
    
* Labels:
    Labels are key value pairs that can be assigned to any resource in the
    system for grouping and selection. Many resources use labels to identify
    sets of other resources.
    
* Volumes:
    Containers are not persistent by default - on restart their contents are
    cleared. Volumes are mounted filesystems available to Pods and their
    containers which may be backed by a number of host-local or network
    attached storage endpoints. The simplest volume type is EmptyDir, which
    is a temporary directory on a single machine. Administrators may also
    allow you to request a Persistent Volume that is automatically attached
    to your pods.
    
* Nodes [node]:
    Machines set up in the cluster to run containers. Usually managed
    by administrators and not by end users.
    
* Services [svc]:
    A name representing a set of pods (or external servers) that are
    accessed by other pods. The service gets an IP and a DNS name, and can be
    exposed externally to the cluster via a port or a Route. It's also easy
    to consume services from pods because an environment variable with the
    name <SERVICE>_HOST is automatically injected into other pods.
    
* Routes [route]:
    A route is an external DNS entry (either a top level domain or a
    dynamically allocated name) that is created to point to a service so that
    it can be accessed outside the cluster. The administrator may configure
    one or more Routers to handle those routes, typically through an Apache
    or HAProxy load balancer / proxy.
    
* Replication Controllers [rc]:
    A replication controller maintains a specific number of pods based on a
    template that match a set of labels. If pods are deleted (because the
    node they run on is taken out of service) the controller creates a new
    copy of that pod. A replication controller is most commonly used to
    represent a single deployment of part of an application based on a
    built image.
    
* Deployment Configuration [dc]:
    Defines the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or
    configuration changes whenever those change. A single deployment
    configuration is usually analogous to a single micro-service. Can support
    many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable
    rolling updates, and fully custom behaviors, as well as pre- and post-
    hooks. Each deployment is represented as a replication controller.
    
* Build Configuration [bc]:
    Contains a description of how to build source code and a base image into a
    new image - the primary method for delivering changes to your application.
    Builds can be source based and use builder images for common languages like
    Java, PHP, Ruby, or Python, or be Docker based and create builds from a
    Dockerfile. Each build configuration has web-hooks and can be triggered
    automatically by changes to their base images.
    
* Builds [build]:
    Builds create a new image from source code, other images, Dockerfiles, or
    binary input. A build is run inside of a container and has the same
    restrictions normal pods have. A build usually results in an image pushed
    to a Docker registry, but you can also choose to run a post-build test that
    does not push an image.
    
* Image Streams and Image Stream Tags [is,istag]:
    An image stream groups sets of related images under tags - analogous to a
    branch in a source code repository. Each image stream may have one or
    more tags (the default tag is called "latest") and those tags may point
    at external Docker registries, at other tags in the same stream, or be
    controlled to directly point at known images. In addition, images can be
    pushed to an image stream tag directly via the integrated Docker
    registry.
    
* Secrets [secret]:
    The secret resource can hold text or binary secrets for delivery into
    your pods. By default, every container is given a single secret which
    contains a token for accessing the API (with limited privileges) at
    /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount. You can create new
    secrets and mount them in your own pods, as well as reference secrets
    from builds (for connecting to remote servers) or use them to import
    remote images into an image stream.
    
* Projects [project]:
    All of the above resources (except Nodes) exist inside of a project.
    Projects have a list of members and their roles, like viewer, editor,
    or admin, as well as a set of security controls on the running pods, and
    limits on how many resources the project can use. The names of each
    resource are unique within a project. Developers may request projects
    be created, but administrators control the resources allocated to
    projects.

Usage:
  oc types [flags]

Examples:
  # View all projects you have access to
  oc get projects
  
  # See a list of all services in the current project
  oc get svc
  
  # Describe a deployment configuration in detail
  oc describe dc mydeploymentconfig
  
  # Show the images tagged into an image stream
  oc describe is ruby-centos7

<span xsmall>ImageStream</span>
@[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.5/html-single/architecture/#image-streams]
NOTE: Image Stream tags must not necesarelly match docker registry images
-  Rather than reference (binary container) images directly,
  application definitions typically abstract the reference
  into an image stream offering a layer of indirection.

- Protect against changes when the current image is upgraded.

- Image streams present a single virtual view of related images,
  similar to an image repository.

- Builds&amp;Deployments can be configured to trigger a new
  Build and/or Deployment when new images are added to the IS

<span xsmall>Deployment</span>
@[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.5/html-single/developer_guide/#deployments]

OCP deployments are described through 3 API/objects:
- DeploymentConfig: describing desired state
- Replication controllers: point-in-time record of the state of a deployment configuration
- 1+ pod/s: 

Ex:
  | kind: "DeploymentConfig"
  | apiVersion: "v1"
  | metadata:
  |   name: "frontend"
  | spec:
  |   template: 1              ← pod template
  |     metadata:
  |       labels:
  |         name: "frontend"
  |     spec:
  |       containers:
  |         - name: "helloworld"
  |           image: "openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
  |           ports:
  |             - containerPort: 8080
  |               protocol: "TCP"
  |   replicas: 5             ← 2
  | 
  |   triggers:
  |     - type: "ConfigChange" 3 ← create new replication contro. any time pod-template changes
  |     - type: "ImageChange"  4 ← create new replication contro. any time image        change
  |       imageChangeParams:
  |         automatic: true
  |         containerNames:
  |           - "helloworld"
  |         from:
  |           kind: "ImageStreamTag"
  |           name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
  |   strategy:                
  |     type: "Rolling"        5 ← Recreate | Rolling* | Custom 
  |   paused: false            6 ← disables triggers to allows multiple simultaneous changes 
  |   revisionHistoryLimit: 2  7 ← limits the limit of old replication controllers in case of roll-back
  |   minReadySeconds: 0       8 ← Minimum seconds to wait (after readiness succeed) for a pod

ºAssigning Pod/Node affinityº
PRE-SETUP
- OCP Admin assigns labels to nodes

NOTE: OCP cluster admins can set the default node selector for a project 
      restricting pod deployments to specific nodes.
      (For example region=east to limit geographical deployment)

STEP 01: Use "po".spec.nodeSelector to filter by node labels
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:   
    disktype: ssd
...

ºRunning a Pod with a Different Service Accountº
$ oc edit dc/$DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG
    spec:
      securityContext: {}
      serviceAccount: 'service_account'      ← edit
      serviceAccountName: 'service_account'  ← edit

<span xsmall>k8s Deployments Support</span>

In the upstream Kubernetes project, a new first-class object 
type called deployments was added in version 1.2. 
This object type (referred to here as Kubernetes deployments
for distinction) serves as a descendant of the deployment
configuration object type.

Support for Kubernetes deployments is available as a
Technology Preview feature.

App promotion:
Routes are the most typical resources that differ stage to stage

 If more than one pod is found "round-roubing" is used.

 3 Services types:
  - (IPTables) HostPort/HosNetwork:  host/port in the "Host" (cluster visible)
  - (IPTables) NodePort: all nodes (included master) will listen in port "X" 
    redirecting to pod

<span xsmall>Templates</span>
@[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.5/html-single/developer_guide/#dev-guide-templates]
"Normal" Flow:
Create app → tune app → export to template → parameterize template

Template = [BuildConfig set, ImageStream set, DeploymentConfig set, 
            Service set, Route set, secret set, ...?]

Template : set of objects that can be parameterized and processed 
           to produce any list of objects you have permission to create
           (services, bc's, dc's).
           - It  may also define a set of labels to apply to every
             object defined in the template.

- A project can contain  a library of templates

$ oc create -f template.json (or yml)   # Upload template

$ oc process \         ← process tpl to generate config.
  -f tpl_file \
  -l name=otherLabel \ ← labels are applied to every generated 

  -p DB_USER=user01 \  ← set/override template param
  -p DB_NAME=DDBB01 \    Alt: Use --param-file=postgres.env

| oc create -f -       ← Pipe STDOUT to create the objects

.parameters section:
 - list of params that can be overriden

$ oc process --parameters -f 'filename' ← list available params for local tpl
$ oc process --parameters 'tpl_name'    ← list available params for uploaded tpl

Example:
$ oc process --parameters -n openshift rails-postgresql-example

... 

 pair you want to override. A parameter reference may appear in any text field inside the template items.

$ oc edit template 'template' ← Edit already uploaded template

$ oc get templates -n openshift

Default OPC templates use a public github source repository containing the necessary app code.
  To build your own version of the application, you must:
  - Fork default repository (SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL parameter)
    and override SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL

<span xsmall>(Java Specific)</span>
- Use it for non-public artifacts and as cache.
- Many maven-aware images have a MAVEN_MIRROR_URL ENV.VAR that can be used to simplify the process
  If not, read the Nexus documentation to configure your build properly.

STEPS:

PRE-SETUP:
Cluster Admin: Setup Read/Write Persistent Volume (PV)

$ oc new-app sonatype/nexus ← Download+deploy the official Nexus container image
               ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑    
             default login: admin
                     pass : admin123

$ oc expose svc/nexus       ← Create route by exposing the newly created Nexus service

$ oc get routes             ← find out the pod's new external address
(output similar to)
→ NAME      HOST/PORT                              PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
→ nexus     nexus-myproject.192.168.1.173.xip.io             nexus      8081-tcp
    
# (Confirm that Nexus is running with wget|curl|...) 

NOTE: Nexus comes pre-configured for the Central Repository, but you may need others
      for your application. For many Red Hat images, it is recommended to add the
      jboss-ga repository at Maven repository.

This is a good time to set up readiness and liveness probes. These will periodically check to see that Nexus is running properly.

$ oc set probe dc/nexus \         ← Set up liveness probes
    --liveness \
    --failure-threshold 3 \
    --initial-delay-seconds 30 \
    -- echo ok
$ oc set probe dc/nexus \         ← Set up readiness probe
    --readiness \
    --failure-threshold 3 \
    --initial-delay-seconds 30 \
    --get-url=http://:8081/nexus/content/groups/public


PERSISTENCE:

<span bgorange>
$ oc volumes dc/nexus --add \             ← Add PVC to the dc/nexus:
    --name 'nexus-volume-1' \               This command replaces the previous emptyDir vol. 
    --type 'pvc' \                          with a 1GB  PVC  mounted at /sonatype-work, 
    --mount-path '/sonatype-work/' \        
    --claim-name 'nexus-pv' \             ← Due to the change in configuration, pod will 
    --claim-size '1G' \                     be redeployed automatically.
    --overwrite
</span>


CREATE A BUILD TO TEST IT:

Define an (example) build using the created Nexus repository. Th

The example builder image supports ENV.VAR MAVEN_MIRROR_URL.
(othewise modify builder image to fix MVN settings)

$ export BASE_IMAGE=openshift/wildfly-100-centos7:latest
$ export    GIT_SRC=https://github.com/openshift/jee-ex.git
$ oc new-build ${BASE_IMAGE}~${GIT_SRC} \
    -e MAVEN_MIRROR_URL='http://nexus.myNexusProject:8081/nexus/content/groups/public'

$ oc logs build/jee-ex-1 --follow

CONFIRMING SUCCESS:

confirm that application’s dependencies have been creating navigating to:
http://<NexusIP>:8081/nexus/content/groups/public

<span xsmall>Service Accounts</span>
12.1. Overview

When a person uses the OpenShift Container Platform CLI or web console, their 
API token authenticates them to the OpenShift API. 

For example Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods.

Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing 
a regular user's credentials.

Service accounts belongs to a given project.

Every service account has an associated user name that can be granted roles, 
just like a regular user.

The user name is derived from its project and name:

system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>

Ex: add the view role to the robot service account in the top-secret project:
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view \
  -z system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot ← z flag (optional) can help avoiding typos/errors


Every service account is also a member of two groups:

system:serviceaccount           Includes all service accounts in the system. 
system:serviceaccount:$project  Includes all service accounts in the specified project. 

Ex: 

# allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in the top-secret project:
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccount -n top-secret
# allow all service accounts in the managers project to edit resources in the top-secret project:
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccount:managers -n top-secret

Default Service Accounts and Roles created in every project:

Service       Account Usage

builder       Used by build pods. It is given the system:image-builder role,
              which allows pushing images to any image stream in the project 
              using the internal Docker registry.

deployer      Used by deployment pods and is given the system:deployer role,
              which allows viewing and modifying replication controllers and
              pods in the project.

default       Used to run all other pods unless they specify a different 
              service account.

All service accounts in a project are given the system:image-puller role,
which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the
internal Docker registry.

<span xsmall>Check if User Can Create Pods (scc-*)</span>
- Using the scc-review and scc-subject-review options,
  you can see if an individual user, or a user under a
  specific service account, can create or update a pod.

- Using the scc-review option, you can check if a service
  account can create or update a pod:
  The command outputs the security context constraints that admit the resource.

Ex: check if a user with the system:serviceaccount:projectname:default service account
    can a create a pod:

  $ oc policy scc-review -z system:serviceaccount:projectname:default -f my_resource.yaml

Ex: check whether a specific user can create or update a pod:

  $ oc policy scc-subject-review -u <username> -f my_resource.yaml

Ex: check if a user belonging to a specific group can create a pod in a specific file:

$ oc policy scc-subject-review -u <username> -g <groupname> -f my_resource.yaml

<span xsmall>Show permissions for authenticated user</span>
Within your project, you can determine what ºverbs(/actions)º you can
perform against all namespace-scoped resources (including third-party resources).

Test scopes in terms of the user and role:

  $ oc policy can-i --list --loglevel=8
  → (output helps you to determine what API request to make to gather the information)

To receive information back in a user-readable format:

  $ oc policy can-i --list
  → (output provides a full list)

To determine if I you can perform specific verbs:

  $ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource>

User scopes can provide more information about a given scope.

  $ oc policy can-i <verb> <resource> --scopes=user:info

<pre zoom>
<span xsmall>Storage Notes</span>
- Specifying a volumeName in your PVC does not prevent a different PVC from 
binding to the specified PV before yours does.  Your claim will remain 
Pending until the PV is Available.
- Therefore, to avoid these scenarios and ensure your claim gets bound to the 
volume you want, you must ensure that both volumeName and claimRef are 
specified.
- You can tell that your setting of volumeName and/or claimRef influenced the 
matching and binding process by inspecting a Bound PV and PVC pair for the pv.
kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller annotation. The PVs and PVCs where you set 
the volumeName and/or claimRef yourself will have no such annotation, but 
ordinary PVs and PVCs will have it set to "yes".
 - When a PV has its claimRef set to some PVC name and namespace, and is 
reclaimed according to a Retain or Recycle reclaim policy, its claimRef will 
remain set to the same PVC name and namespace even if the PVC or the whole 
namespace no longer exists.

Service Accounts


Overview

When a person uses the command line or web console, their API token authenticates them to the OpenShift API. However, when a regular user’s credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls independently. For example:

    Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods

    Applications inside containers can make API calls for discovery purposes

    External applications can make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes

Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a regular user’s credentials.
Usernames and groups

Every service account has an associated username that can be granted roles, just like a regular user. The username is derived from its project and name: system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>

For example, to add the view role to the robot service account in the top-secret project:

$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot

Every service account is also a member of two groups:

    system:serviceaccounts, which includes all service accounts in the system

    system:serviceaccounts:<project>, which includes all service accounts in the specified project

For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in the top-secret project:

$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n top-secret

To allow all service accounts in the managers project to edit resources in the top-secret project:

$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n top-secret

Enable service account authentication

Service accounts authenticate to the API using tokens signed by a private RSA key. The authentication layer verifies the signature using a matching public RSA key.

To enable service account token generation, update the master configuration serviceAccountConfig stanza to specify a privateKeyFile (for signing), and a matching public key file in the publicKeyFiles list:

serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  masterCA: ca.crt 
  privateKeyFile: serviceaccounts.private.key 
  publicKeyFiles:
  - serviceaccounts.public.key 
  - ...

    CA file used to validate the API server’s serving certificate
    Private RSA key file (for token signing)
    Public RSA key files (for token verification). If private key files are provided, then the public key component is used. Multiple public key files can be specified, and a token will be accepted if it can be validated by one of the public keys. This allows rotation of the signing key, while still accepting tokens generated by the previous signer.
Managed service accounts

Service accounts are required in each project to run builds, deployments, and other pods. The managedNames setting in the master configuration file controls which service accounts are automatically created in every project:

serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  managedNames: 
  - builder 
  - deployer 
  - default 
  - ...

    List of service accounts to automatically create in every project
    A builder service account in each project is required by build pods, and is given the system:image-builder role, which allows pushing images to any image stream in the project using the internal Docker registry.
    A deployer service account in each project is required by deployment pods, and is given the system:deployer role, which allows viewing and modifying replication controllers and pods in the project.
    A default service account is used by all other pods unless they specify a different service account.

All service accounts in a project are given the system:image-puller role, which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the internal Docker registry.
Infrastructure service accounts

Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials. The following service accounts are created in the OpenShift infrastructure namespace at server start, and given the following roles cluster-wide:

    The replication-controller service account is assigned the system:replication-controller role

    The deployment-controller service account is assigned the system:deployment-controller role

    The build-controller service account is assigned the system:build-controller role. Additionally, the build-controller service account is included in the privileged security context constraint in order to create privileged build pods.

To configure the namespace where those service accounts are created, set the openshiftInfrastructureNamespace field in the master configuration file:

policyConfig:
  ...
  openshiftInfrastructureNamespace: openshift-infra

Set limitSecretReferences field in master configuration file to true to require pod secret references to be whitelisted by their service accounts. Set its value to false to allow pods to reference any secret in the namespace.

serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  limitSecretReferences: false

______________________________
 If a Jenkinsfile exists in the root or specified context directory of the source repository when creating a new application, OpenShift Container Platform generates a Pipeline build strategy. Otherwise, if a Dockerfile is found, OpenShift Container Platform generates a Docker build strategy. Otherwise, it generates a Source build strategy.

You can override the build strategy by setting the --strategy flag to either docker, pipeline or source.

$ oa new-app /home/user/code/myapp --strategy=docker

Deploying OpenShift Container Platform 3 on VMware vSphere
Updated July 12 2018 at 6:46 PM - English

This reference architecture describes how to deploy and manage Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 on VMware vSphere. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform allows for specific configuration parameters to be set to take full advantage of cloud specific features. These documents explain how OpenShift and vSphere can be used together for a successful installation and deployment. Also, steps and links to a code base will be provided to allow for the installation of the exact reference architecture environment using a VMware vSphere account.

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible Docker images from source code. S2I produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a Docker container and letting the container prepare that source code for execution. By creating self-assembling builder images, you can version and control your build environments exactly like you use Docker images to version your runtime environments
