@[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks]

Client-Side Hooks
- not copied when you clone a repository
  - to enforce a policy do on the server side
- committing-workflow hooks:
  -ºpre-commitºhook:
    - First script to be executed.
    - used to inspect the snapshot that's about to be committed.
      - Check you’ve NOT forgotten something
      - make sure tests run
      - Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit
    (can be bypassed with git commit --no-verify flag)
  -ºprepare-commit-msgºhook:
    - Params:
      - commit_message_path (template for final commit message)
      - type of commit
      - commit SHA-1 (if this is an amended commit)
    - run before the commit message editor is fired up 
      but after the default message is created.
    - It lets you edit the default message before the
      commit author sees it.
    - Used for non-normal-commits with auto-generated messages
      - templated commit messages
      - merge commits
      - squashed commits
      - amended commits
  -ºcommit-msgºhook:
      - commit_message_path (written by the developer)
  -ºpost-commitºhook:
    - (you can easily get the last commit by running git log -1 HEAD)
    - Generally, this script is used for notification or something similar.

-ºemail-workflowº hooks:
  - invoked by ºgit amº
                ^^^^^^
                Apply a series of patches from a mailbox
                prepared by git format-patch

  -ºapplypatch-msgº: 
    - Params:
      - temp_file_path containing the proposed commit message.
  -ºpre-applypatchº:
    - confusingly, it is run after the patch is 
      applied but before a commit is made.
    - can be used it to inspect the snapshot before making the commit,
      run tests,  inspect the working tree with this script.
  -ºpost-applypatchº:
    - runs after the commit is made.
    - Useful to notify a group or the author of the patch
      you pulled in that you’ve done so. 

- Others:
  -ºpre-rebaseºhook:
    - runs before you rebase anything
    - Can be used to disallow rebasing any commits
      that have already been pushed.
  -ºpost-rewriteºhook:
    - Params:
      - command_that_triggered_the_rewrite: 
        - It receives a list of rewrites on stdin.
    - run by commands that replace commits
      such as 'git commit --amend' and 'git rebase'
      (though not by git filter-branch).
    - This hook has many of the same uses as the
      post-checkout and post-merge hooks.
  -ºpost-checkoutºhook:
    - Runs after successful checkout
    - you can use it to set up your working directory
      properly for your project environment.
      This may mean moving in large binary files that 
      you don't want source controlled, auto-generating
      documentation, or something along those lines.
  -ºpost-mergeºhook:
    - runs after a successful merge command.
    - You can use it to restore data in the working tree
      that Git can't track, such as permissions data.
      It can likewise validate the presence of files 
      external to Git control that you may want copied 
      in when the working tree changes.
  -ºpre-pushºhook:
    - runs during git push, after the remote refs
      have been updated but before any objects have
      been transferred.
    - It receives the name and location of the remote
      as parameters, and a list of to-be-updated refs
      through stdin.
    - You can use it to validate a set of ref updates before
      a push occurs (a non-zero exit code will abort the push).

<span xsmall bgorange>Server-Side Hooks</span>
(system administrator only)
- Useful to enforce nearly any kind of policy for your project.

- can exit non-zero at any time to reject the push 
  as well as print an error message back to the client; 

- you can set up a push policy that's as complex as you wish.

ºpre-receiveº hook:
 - first script to run 
 - takes a list of references that are being pushed from stdin;
   if it exits non-zero, none of them are accepted. 
 - You can use this hook to do things like make sure none of the updated 
   references are non-fast-forwards, or to do access control for all the refs 
   and files they’re modifying with the push.

ºupdateº
 - very similar to the pre-receive script, except that 
  ºit's run once for each branch the pusher is trying to updateº.
 - If the pusher is trying to push to multiple branches, pre-receive runs only once,
   whereas update runs once per branch they're pushing to.
 - Instead of reading from stdin, this script takes three arguments:
   - the name of the reference (branch),
   - the SHA-1 that reference pointed to before the push, 
   - the SHA-1 the user is trying to push.
 - If the update script exits non-zero, only that reference is rejected; 
   other references can still be updated.

ºpost-receiveº
 - runs after the entire process is completed 
 - can be used to update other services or notify users.
 - It takes the same stdin data as the pre-receive hook.
 - Examples include emailing a list, notifying a CI server,
   or updating a ticket-tracking system 
   You can even parse the commit messages to see if any
   tickets need to be opened, modified, or closed.
 - This script can't stop the push process, but the client 
   doesn't disconnect until it has completed, so be careful
   if you try to do anything that may take a long time.

- git-pw requires patchwork v2.0, since it uses the 
  new REST API and other improvements, such as understanding
  the difference between patches, series and cover letters,
  to know exactly what to try and apply.

- python-based tool that integrates git and patchwork.

  $ pip install --user git-pw

CONFIG:
  $ git config pw.server https://patchwork.kernel.org/api/1.1
  $ git config pw.token YOUR_USER_TOKEN_HERE

ºDaily work exampleº
finding and applying series
- Alternative 1: Manually
  - We could use patchwork web UI search engine for it.
    - Go to "linux-rockchip" project 
    - click on _"Show patches with" to access the filter menu.
    - filter by submitter. 

- Alternative 2: git-pw (REST API wrapper)
  - $ git-pw --project linux-rockchip series list "dynamically"
    → ID    Date         Name              Version   Submitter
    → 95139 a day ago    Add support ...   3         Gaël PORTAY
    → 93875 3 days ago   Add support ...   2         Gaël PORTAY
    → 3039  8 months ago Add support ...   1         Enric Balletbo i Serra

    → Received    5 of 5
    → Complete    True
    → Cover       10864561 [v3,0/5] Add support ....
    → Patches     10864575 [v3,1/5] devfreq: rockchip-dfi: Move GRF definitions to a common place.
    →     10864579 [v3,2/5] : devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Add rockchip, pmu phandle.
    →     10864589 [v3,3/5] devfreq: rk3399_dmc: Pass ODT and auto power down parameters to TF-A.
    →     10864591 [v3,4/5] arm64: dts: rk3399: Add dfi and dmc nodes.
    →     10864585 [v3,5/5] arm64: dts: rockchip: Enable dmc and dfi nodes on gru.


  - Applying the entire series (or at least trying to):
    $ git-pw series apply 95139
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    fetch all the patches in the series, and apply them in the right order.

    _______________
MurmurHash is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup.[1] It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008[2] and is currently hosted on GitHub along with its test suite named 'SMHasher'. It also exists in a number of variants,[3] all of which have been released into the public domain. The name comes from two basic operations, multiply (MU) and rotate (R), used in its inner loop.

source{d} Engine: A Simple, Elegant Way to Analyze your Code
- With the recent advances in machine learning technology, it is only a 
matter of time before developers can expect to run full diagnostics and 
information retrieval on their own source code. This can include 
autocompletion, auto-generated user tests, more robust linters, automated 
code reviews and more. I recently reviewed a new product in this sphere : the 
source{d} Engine.
source{d} offers a suite of applications that uses machine learning on code 
to complete source code analysis and assisted code reviews. Chief among them 
is the source{d} Engine, now in public beta; it uses a suite of open source 
tools (such as Gitbase, Babelfish, and Enry) to enable large-scale source 
code analysis. Some key uses of the source{d} Engine include language 
identification, parsing code into abstract syntax trees, and performing SQL 
Queries on your source code such as:
  - What are the top repositories in a codebase based on number of commits?
  - What is the most recent commit message in a given repository?
  - Who are the most prolific contributors in a repository

https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/01/git-2-25-sparse-checkout/
Git maintainer Junio C Hamano announced the latest release of Git, version 
2.25, including over 500 changes since 2.24. Most notably, Git 2.25 adds a new 
command to manage sparse checkouts, mostly useful with huge or monolithic 
repositories.

Sparse checkouts are one of several approaches Git supports to improve 
performance when working with big repositories. Specifically, sparse checkouts 
are useful to keep your working directory clean by specifying which directories 
to keep. This is useful, for example, with repositories containing thousands of 
directories.
