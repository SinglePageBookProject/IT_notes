<span xsmall>Don't Use Blockchain</span>
- Don't Use Blockchain:
  - A single entity writes data    (Prefer a database) 
  - A single entity is in control  (Prefer a database)
  - There is trust among entitites (Prefer a database, maybe with audit logs for tracing)
    writing data (There are no
    bizantine attackers)
  - Your data lacks legal,monetary (Prefer a database)
    value.

- Reasons to use a blockchain
  + You need a shared vision (for example the money or token of each participant),
  + the data must be distributed.
  + There is no controlling entity.
  + Non-using blockchain leads to outdated/duplicated data
  + There is an economical motivation to cheat the system.
    (money, identity forgery, ...)
  + There is an interest in "digitalizing" rights/obligations

- soft-vs-hard fork:
  - soft-fork: backwards compatible protocol change (addition)
    soft-forks can be implemented with merely a superemajority of the mining
    computational power participating, rather than all full nodes.
    However, participants' security with respect to the soft-forked features is
    only SPV-level until they upgrade. (Soft-forks have been used several times to
    deploy new features and fix security issues in Bitcoin)
    See also <a TODO href="https://www.jeffcoleman.ca/soft-fork-any-feature-into-bitcoin/">How to Soft Fork any Feature into Bitcoin</a>

- Colored coin ("ERC20")
  @[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins]
  - The term loosely describes a class of methods for representing and managing 
    real world assets on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain
  - """Script extensions (for example, to efficiently support coloured coins[jl213])
     have been proposed for Bitcoin. Since such extensions are usable only by a 
     small subset of users, but all users would need to deal with the increased 
     complexity and risk of subtle interactions, these extensions have not been 
     accepted into Bitcoin"""
  - Ethereum uses ERC20 token Standard with the same purpose.

-ºDemurrageº:
  mechanism for achieving block rewards an idea pioneered for digital 
  currency by Freicoin (http://freico.in) in which all unspent outputs lose 
  value over time, with the lost value being recollected by miners. This 
  keeps the currency supply stable while still rewarding miners. It may be 
  better aligned with user interests than inflation because loss to demurrage
  is enacted uniformly everywhere and instantaneously, unlike inflation; it 
  also mitigates the possibility of long-unspent "lost" coins being reanimated
  at their current valuation and shocking the economy, which is a perceived 
  risk in Bitcoin. Demurrage creates incentives to increase monetary velocity
  and lower interest rates, which are considered (e.g. by Freicoin advocates 
  and other supporters of Silvio Gesell’s theory of interest[Ges16]) to be 
  socially beneficial. In pegged sidechains, demurrage allows miners to be 
  paid in existing already-valued currency

- Pay-to-script-hash: Payment where recipient is an smart-contract|script (vs 
  legal entity).


- TX malleability: potential problem allowing arbitrary users to 
  tweak transaction data in a way that breaks any later transactions 
  which depend on them, even though the actual content of the 
  transaction is unchanged. (Specially in Bitcoin and related techs).
  An example of a protocol broken by transaction malleability is 
  probabilistic payments [Cal12].

<span xsmall>CAP Theorem</span>
@[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem]
-  In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem
  after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a 
  distributed (distributed == physically distant) data store to simultaneously
  provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:
  ┌───────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
  │ ºConsistencyº             │ºAvailabilityº            │ºPartition toleranceº         │
  ├───────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
  │Every read receives the    │ Every request receives   │ The system continues to      │
  │most recent write or       │ a (non─error) response   │ operate despite an arbitrary │
  │an error.                  │ - without guarantee that │ number of messages being     │
  │"One truth of what happent │ it contains the most     │ dropped (or delayed) by the  │
  │and in what order"         │ recent write             │ network between nodes        │
  └───────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘

Consensus in public blockchains refers to methods to warrant parititon 
tolerance (global vision of state by all nodes), sacrifying availability 
(transactions are sent for "mining" to the network but there is no warranty
of success (even error) response.
- We speak about "Eventual Consistency", if we consider that the network is 
always running but the unique view (consistency) will take time to "propagate" 
using the consensus algorithm.

<span xsmall>Eventual consistency</span>
- @[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency]
  is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve 
  high availability that informally guarantees that , if no new updates 
  are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item 
  will return the last updated value.[1] Eventual consistency, also 
  called optimistic replication,[2] is widely deployed in distributed 
  systems, and has origins in early mobile computing projects.[3] A 
  system that has achieved eventual consistency is often said to have 
  converged, or achieved replica convergence.[4] Eventual consistency 
  is a weak guarantee – most stronger models, like linearizability 
  are trivially eventually consistent, but a system that is merely 
  eventually consistent does not usually fulfill these stronger 
  constraints.  Eventually- consistent services are often classified as 
  providing BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual 
  consistency) semantics, in contrast to traditional ACID ( Atomicity, 
  Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees .[5][6] Eventual 
  consistency is sometimes criticized[7] as increasing the complexity 
  of distributed software applications. This is partly because eventual 
  consistency is purely a liveness guarantee (reads eventually return 
  the same value) and does not make safety guarantees: an eventually 
  consistent system can return any value before it converges.

<span xsmall>Distributed Consensus</span>
  Asynchronous Bizantine Fault Tolerant Consensus (Public BC)
- The Byzantine General’s Problem was first proposed by 
  SIFT in the 1970s to tolerate real-time faults in 
  commercial aircraft and then given the name by Lamport, 
  Shostak, and Pease in 1982. It described the problem of 
  achieving distributed agreement over a compromised 
  communications network — of making "a reliable system 
  from unreliable parts", as Ethan Buchman of Cosmos puts it.
  From 1982 to 1999, no one had invented a system that 
  solved the Byzantine General’s Problem. It was irrelevant 
  to computing for a long time because, at the time, the 
  internet had evolved out of cloud-based central computing;
  all that was needed was fault-tolerance.
  
- So, crash-fault tolerant algorithms like Paxos, invented 
  in the late 1980s, and Raft, invented in 2013, were 
  widely deployed. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT
  ) was created in 1999, but was not really adopted by 
  anyone outside of academia. The breakthrough that Satoshi 
  Nakamoto made in 2008 was in bringing internet-scale 
  distributed Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)consensus into 
  a blockchain scheme. Once that demonstration happened, a 
  lot of the people from the systems research community 
  started to formulate ideas around applying what was 
  largely an academic curiosity to a real-world application.


- (TX ordering) Consensus is very simple to implement in syncrhonous systems
  where a central ("God") server with a single internal timer takes care
  of ordering. Due to physical constraint (speed of light) it's not possible
  to establish a global time for distributed nodes  (CAP problem) so that
  all nodes agree at once about the timestamp of each TX generated "randomnly"
  (and asyncrhonously) by any node
- consensus tries to solve the "P"artitioning problem in the CAP problem 
  to warrant all the network physically distributed nodes agree on the same state.
  This is done at the cost of the "A"vailability property, since
  A transaction (=="proposal to change the state") can be executed/mined fast, slow
  or "never".

<span xsmall>FLP impossibility Result</span>
from: @[https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf]
Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson shown
in "Impossibility of distributed consensus with one faulty process",
(Journal of the ACM, vol 32, n.2, pp 374-382, 1985) that in 
an asynchronous system (where no assumptions are made about time) of
deterministic processes, no protocol can guarantee consensus even with 
one faulty process (non-termination is always a possibility for a
consensus algorithm). This is called the FLP impossibility result.
Much research has gone into understanding ways to circumvent the 
FLP imposibility result by slightly modifying th problem 
domain, e.g, by sacrificing determinism, adding time, adding
oracles, etc... (Byzantine consensus in asynchronous 
message-passing systems:
International Journal of Critical Computer-Based Systems , 
vol. 2, no. 2, pp. 141–161, 2011).  Bitcoin circumvents the FLP
impossibility result by making some pragmatic assumptions about
the synchrony of the network (i.e., nodes sync up soon with the 
network) and time (i.e, miners dedicate limited time and
resources to the best blockchain).  Basically it introduces the
 necessity for time-based heuristics, to ensure convergence 
(or at least repeated iterations of non-convergence).

<span xsmall>Triple Entry Accountancy</span>
@[http://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html]
- 3 local entries for each of 3 roles, the result of which I call triple entry accounting.
- Bullet proof accounting systems for aggressive uses
- lowers costs by delivering reliable and supported accounting, 
- it makes much stronger governance possible in a way that positively impacts
on the future needs of corporate and public accounting.
- Double Entry: add a clear strategy to identify and remove errors.
  It has a side effect of clearly firewalling errors as either accident
  or fraud.
  This property is enabled by means of three features:
  - separation of all books into two groups or sides, called assets and liabilities
  - redundancy of the duplicative double entries with each entry having a match on the other side
  - balance sheet equation (sum of all entries on the asset side must equal the sum of all entries on the liabilities side)
     
  - This then leads to an audit strategy:
    - First, ensure that all entries are complete, in that they refer to their counterpart.
    - Second, ensure that all movements of value make sense. 
     
   - The digital signature is capable of creating a record with some strong 
     degree of reliabilty, at least in the senses expressed by ACID:
     - A digital signature can be relied upon to keep a record safe, as it will fail to verify if
  anyetails in the record are changed
     - ºassuming that the original record was created correctly, then later º
       ºerrors are revealed, bo of an accidental nature and of fraudulent intent.º
     - digital signature gives us a particular property:
       "at a given point in time, this information was seen and marked by the signing computer.
       providing a new way to create reliable and trustworthy entries "
       (variants with softer and harder claims exits like message digests and 
        public key cryptosystems)
     
   - ºInitial Role of a Receipt:º
     let's assume a simple three party payment system: Alice, Bob (two users) and Ivan (the Issuer)
     - each party holds an authorising key which can be used to sign their instructions.
     - Alice wishes to transfer value to Bob in some unit or contract managed by Ivan:
       Alice → Alice : + signed payment instruction ( similar to a cheque)
       Alice → Ivan  :   signed payment instruction ( similar to a cheque)
       Alice → Alice :   Update internal set of books
       Ivan  → Ivan  : + signed (receipt)
       Ivan  → Alice :   signed (receipt)
       Ivan  → Bob   :   signed (receipt)
       Ivan  → Ivan  :   Update internal set of books

      ºThe Receipt is the Transaction!!!º
     - The Issuer (Ivan) is the risk source of insider fraud:
       A single centralised server for issuers of the unit of digital value 
       and any governance partners such as the server operators are powerful candidates 
       for insider fraud.
     - To address the risk of insider fraud, the written issuer signed receipt was
       historically introduced as being a primary source of evidence.
       To achieve a complete binding, Alice's original authorisation
       is also included within the record.

       OºOwner  signatureº: evidence of both the user's intention
       OºIssuer signatureº:  server's action in response

   - Most efficient record keeping strategy:
     drop all interim records and keep safe the (multi)signed receipt
    ºThis allows us to state the following principle:  º
    ºThe User and the Issuer hold the same information.º
     
   - We bind a signed contract of issuance known as a Ricardian Contract into the receipt:
       This invention relates a digitally signed document securely to the 
       signed receipt by means of a unique identifier called a message 
       digest, again provided by cryptography.
       It provides strong binding for the unit of account, the nature of the 
       issue, the terms, conditions and promises being made by the Issuer, and 
       of course the identity of the Issuer.
     

ºSIGNED RECEIPT AS A BOOK-KEEPING SYSTEMº
- Single Entry (Signed receipt) system:
    To calculate balances a book would be constructed on the fly from the set for signed receipts.
    (using the Signed Receipt as a basis for single entry bookkeeping)
  
- Recovering Double Entry:
     The Issuer server (Ivan) has to accept each new transaction on
     the basis of the available balance in the effected books; 
     for this reason it needs those books to be available efficiently.
     Alice and Bob both are granted a book each within the server's architecture.
     We place those books on the liabilities side of the issuer:
     - Receipts then can be placed in a separate single book (logically placed on the assets side)
     - Each TX from Alice to Bob now has a logical contra entry, and is then represented
       in 3 places (ºTriple Entry Accounting!!º) within the accounts of the server.
  
-ºIn practice digital signature reduces the accounting problem to one ofº
 ºthe receipt's presence                                                º
-ºAlthough digitally signed receipt dominates in information terms, in  º
 ºprocessing terms it falls short.                                      º

  
-ºIt's Worth stating that the technique of signing receipts works both with private                º
 ºkey signatures and also with entanglement message digest signatures; whether the security aspectsº
 ºof these techniques is adequate to task is dependent on the business environment.                º

RºPROBLEMSº
  - loss of receipts
  - counting of balances by the client side software
  
- Patterns of Transactions
  -A particular transaction in business almost never stands alone. They come in patterns.
   For example offers and acceptances form a wider transaction but seldom encapsulate the entire
    fulfillment and payment cycle. 
  
- Conclusion
    Double Entry bookkeeping provides evidence of intent and origin,
    leading to strategies for dealing with errors of accident and fraud. 
    The financial cryptography invention of the signed receipt provides the same benefits,
    and thus challenges the 800 year reign of double entry. Indeed, in evidentiary terms,
    the signed receipt is more powerful than double entry records due to the
    technical qualities of its signature.

<span xsmall>Digital cash</span>
  <li>Introduced in 1983 by David Chaim as a research topic in 1983 in a setting 
  with a central server that is trusted to prevent double-spending. To mitigate
  the privacy risk to individuals from this central trusted party, and to
  enforce fungibility, Chaum introduced the blind signature, to provent linking 
  of the central server's signatures (which represent coins), while still 
  allowing the central server to perform double-spend prevention
  - Bitcoin replaced the need for a central server by introducing Proof-of-work
    as a distributed signature

BºBlockchain is an specialized database whose main purpose is toº
Bºtrack the "rights" and "obligations" of its participants.º
 
 The first blokchain put into production, the Bitcoin Network, as 
 well as many other public blockchain are specialized databases 
 to track the crypto-currency owned by all and anyone of its
 participants. Notice that money is just a "right" (from the owner's
 point of view) or an "obligation" (from the bank emissor's point of view)

More feature-rich blockchains will provide with programable logic
(smart-contracts) to describe advanced forms of "rights" and "obligations",
that describe common contracts used by financial entities or industry.

This specialization arise from the following ºthree distintive characteristicsº:

 1) All "inputs" modifying the state are cryptographically signed.

 2) All "inputs" must have being previously acepted by a network-consensus
    before being accepted by the blockchain.

 3) The log of accepted inputs (accepted signed transactions) is
    inmutable. 

1) By forcing all inputs (transactions modifying the state) to be signed 
   the blockchain guaranties that:

  - Transactions can not be tampered by anyone by the owner of 
    the private key.

  - The transaction is non-repudiable: The signer can not neglect
    having signed it.

2) By forcing all inputs to be accepted by the network consensus the blockchain
   guaranties that different participants see the same transactions in the
   same other (See CAP problem later on)

3) By forcing the inmutability of the log the blockchain guaranties
   that accepted transactions can not be removed or modified later in time.

Depending on the consensus applied and the previous agreements by the
blockchain network  participants, 
ºthe cited characteristics provides a legal value to the network.º

 In practice when a user signs a transaction, this transaction will always
represent a decrease of its "rights" or an increase of its "obligations".

 To increase a user's "rights" or decrease the user's "obligations" the
possibilities are:

 - Another user will sign a new transaction transfering rights to the
   user or decresing its contracted obligations.

 - In public networks the "mining" proceduce will increase the 
   crypto-currency (rights) to succesful miners.

 - In private networks a previous established agreement between 
   participants will provide a procedure to establish new rights to
   users. (crypto-currency, assets, tokens, ...).

<span title>                              </span>
<span xsmall>Blockchain in Practice</span>
The whole point of a blockchain is to establish agreement on a 
canonical ordering of a set of transactions.

Over time, participants in the network sign the history, effectively 
endorsing everything that came before it and adding a new set of 
entries to the history. What this means is that a blockchain itself is 
really a kind of collective signature, whose membership is sampled 
repeatedly from a fluctuating distribution of resources allocated in 
the network, this is the "network" in action, or sometimes called consensus.

Agreement refers to the problem of maintaining a single global
truth in the face of a decentralized accounting system.
While similar to the correctness problem, the difference lies
in the fact that while a malicious user of the network may be
unable to create a fraudulent transaction (defying correctness), 
it may be able to create multiple correct transactions that are
somehow unaware of each other, and thus combine to create a fraudulent act.
For example, a malicious user may make two simultaneous purchases, 
with only enough funds in their account to cover each purchase individually,
but not both together.   Thus each transaction by itself is correct,
but if executed simultaneously in such a way that the distributed network
as a whole is unaware of both, a clear problem arises, commonly referred
to as the “Double-Spend Problem” [1]. Thus the agreement problem can be
summarized as the requirement that only one set of globally recognized
transactions exist in the network

One way to define a blockchain is a distributed database (DB) that solves
the "Strong Byzantine Generals" (SBG) problem[13], the name given to a
combination of the Byzantine Generals Problem and the Sybil Attack Problem.
 In the Byzantine Generals Problem [14], nodes need to agree on some value
for a DB entry, under the constraint that the nodes may fail in arbitrary 
ways (including malicious behavior) unfairly disproportionate influence in 
the process of agreeing on a value for an entry.  It's an \attack of the
clones"|an army of seemingly independent voters actually working together
to game the system.

   @[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/07/postgres-kafka-bitcoin-common.html]
     """all three of these technologies have one interesting thing in common: their use of the immutable log
     Postgres uses something called an immutable Write-Ahead log, or WAL.
     Modifications of state are appended to the WAL before any significant updates to permanent storage.
     Followers can then read the log to apply these changes to their own copy to guarantee consistency.
  
     In Kafka, streams of data are divided up into partitions, where each partition is an immutable
     log of ordered messages. Every new message that enters the system is appended to a partition. 
     All consumers of the log keep track of what they've consumed themselves, so in case of an error,
     they can pick up from where they left off. And because the messages are ordered, all consumers 
     get them in the same, intended order! No need to worry about race conditions.

     Bitcoin uses an immutable log in the form of something called a blockchain, for all parties
     to agree on a history of transactions. In a blockchain, transactions are bundled into blocks, 
     and each block has data regarding the previous block's hash, creating a chain of blocks. This 
     makes it really hard for malicious agents to tamper with data records because of encryption. 
     If a transaction of block N is tampered, then block N's hash will change, which means block N+1's
     will be referencing a nonexistent block, breaking the blockchain. Even if a malicious agent 
     successfully tampered and re-mined the whole blockchain (which already takes significant 
     processing power), a simple comparison with a different copy of the blockchain would easily find
     tampering, making it hard for people to hack the system.

     Immutability as a concept seems so intuitive, so why have update-in-place approaches been
     the de-facto way of doing things for so long? A big reason is because storage used to be so expensive.
     But now, with advances with processing power and a significant decrease in the cost of storage,
     the solution of immutable logs is much more economically feasible, which means you'll be seeing more
     and more of it being used in technologies in the future. """

<span xsmall>Consortium networks</span>
From "Hands-on BC with Hyperledger"
""" William Shakespeare said that the world is a stage on which men and women are the actors. 
    The actions amongst actors can be tought of as as transactions....
    A business network is a collection of participants and assets than 
    undergo a life cycle described by transactions. Events occur when 
    transactions complete."""
There are three types of participants in a business network:

- Individual: A "human" like a teacher, student, bank customer, end-customer/end-consumer ...  
- Organizational participants: The most important actors in a business network, a bank,
              school, insurance company, ... A organization out-spans the life-cycle of
              its individuals. In practice individuals will act on behalf of the organization, 
              and with the authority of that organization.
- System or device participants: represent the technology components. Are sort of special 
    individuals, like the ERP system, the payment engines, reservation systems, ...

All participants have an "agency" attribute (act at will - this translate in having
a private key to sign their transaction intentions) and an identity.

 The fundamental nature of a business network—that it is comprised of participants
involved in the meaningful exchange of assets.
ºThe most important concept in business networks is the exchange.º

A blockchain can provide a simpler, more comprehensive, approach to business-
to-business (B2B) information processing across multiple organizations. 
Whereas Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) protocols are only concerned with 
the exchange of information, a blockchain can store data in a ledger, process 
data with smart contracts, and communicate and exchange data via consensus. 
Blockchain provides a holistic approach to multi-party transaction processing
. In a blockchain, all the processing, data, and communications in a business 
network are accessed from one coherent system. That's in contrast to a 
traditional B2B approach where data, processing, and exchange are managed by 
different systems. This separation directly results in significant amounts 
processing to join-up information across these systems, and a lack of overall 
transparency. This process is described as reconciliation—it ensures that 
that there are not significant differences between the information at 
different parts of the business network—it is timely and costly.

We now see the benefits of implementing a business network on a blockchain. 
Rather than a set of different systems that record assets, and different 
programs that operate on them, there is a shared view of the asset and its 
complete transactional life cycle. Blockchain provides an explicit shared 
understanding of the asset and its life cycle, of participants, transactions, 
and events. This shared nature of blockchain provides increased trust through 
increased transparency, and that radically simplifies and accelerates 
processing. For example, organizations don't have to perform periodic 
reconciliation with other counterparts to make sure that their systems tally—
because everything tallies all the time, in a blockchain.

<span xsmall>Economy of mechanism</span>
United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team Department Homeland Security
@[https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/economy-of-mechanism]
- One factor in evaluating a system's security is its complexity.
  If the design, implementation, or security mechanisms are highly complex, 
  then the likelihood of security vulnerabilities increases. Subtle problems 
  in complex systems may be difficult to find, especially in copious amounts 
  of code. For instance, analyzing the source code that is responsible for the
  normal execution of a functionality can be a difficult task, but checking 
  for alternate behaviors in the remaining code that can achieve the same 
  functionality can be even more difficult. One strategy for simplifying code
  is the use of choke points, where shared functionality reduces the amount 
  of source code required for an operation. Simplifying design or code is not
  always easy, but developers should strive for implementing simpler systems 
  when possible.
- According to Saltzer and Schroeder [Saltzer 75] in "Basic Principles of
  Information Protection" from page 8:
  Economy of mechanism: Keep the design as simple and small as possible. This 
  well-known principle applies to any aspect of a system, but it deserves 
  emphasis for protection mechanisms for this reason: design and 
  implementation errors that result in unwanted access paths will not be 
  noticed during normal use (since normal use usually does not include 
  attempts to exercise improper access paths). As a result, techniques such 
  as line-by-line inspection of software and physical examination of hardware
  that implements protection mechanisms are necessary. For such techniques to
  be successful, a small and simple design is essential.

- That depends on the model of computation we are talking about.
    There are two competing computational models used in decentralised
    databases: [ virtual  computer ,  UTXO ]:
- The virtual computer model is used by Ethereum: It models the
    database as the in-memory state of a global computer with a single
    thread of execution determined by the block chain.
- In the UTXO model, as used in Bitcoin, the database is a set
    of immutable rows keyed by (hash:output index).  Transactions 
    define outputs that append new rows and inputs which consume
    existing rows.

        Cryptocurrencies such as Tenebrix and Litecoin use a simplified version of Scrypt.
        that still require significant computing memory resources.
        It did not take long for companies to start producing Scrypt ASICs.
        Powerful AMD graphics cards are more than capable of mining the Scrypt algorithm
        Variants:
    
      - Scrypt-N: Changes memory requirement of the algorithm every set amount of time.
            This way even if ASICs are developed for the algorithm, a few years later they
            become obsolete as the "N" changes and creates the need for different circuits 
            in order to mine the hashes.
      - Scrypt-OG: 8 times less memory-intensive than Scrypt. (OG="Optimized for GPU")
      - Scrypt-Jane:

REF: @[https://blog.cosmos.network/understanding-the-basics-of-a-proof-of-stake-security-model-de3b3e160710]
  -BºMuch more scalable than PoW.º
  - See also "The long road to Proof-of-Stake":
  @[https://blog.cosmos.network/consensus-compare-casper-vs-tendermint-6df154ad56ae]
  - First introduced in Tendermint by Jae Kwon, who, in 2014.
    Stake: Assuming majority economic agents are not Byzantine 
    but rational, we can devise certain in-protocol incentives
    to modify decisions with determinism. The leveraging of 'stake'
    in Proof-of-Stake consensus provides stronger security guarantees 
    than Proof-of-Work consensus due to the bonding of collateralized
    capital, or security deposits. Utilizing this is so key to modern,
    fault tolerant PoS design, that the major protocols like Tendermint
    and Casper adopt security deposits at the core of their incentive
    mechanisms.
   ºThis is because stake that is bonded by a node which exhibits    º
   ºfaulty behavior can be forfeit, or 'slashed', by the protocol.   º
   ºThe protocol can therefore define some strong disincentive, or   º
   ºmaximal penalty for incorrect behavior which can potentially far º
   ºoutweigh any transaction fees or mining rewards defined for      º
   ºcorrect behavior.º

  º'Validators' as Securityº
       In Proof-of-Stake, the consensus nodes are known as validators,
       whereas in Proof-of-Work, they are known as miners. The term
       'bonded validator', or 'validator' for short, was first introduced
       by Jae Kwon in his pivotal white paper, Tendermint: Consensus
       without Mining. Each validator's voting power, or weight, amounts
       to the proportion of stake that's self-funded or allotted to them.
       All three of the aforementioned consensus protocols employ dynamic
       validator sets.

  - In many systems, not all validators will have the same "weight" in the
    consensus protocol. Thus, we are not so much interested in 1/3 or 2/3
    of the validators, but in those proportions of the total voting power,
    which may not be uniformly distributed across individual validators.
    So when you hear "2/3 or more" validators, what you’re really hearing
    can be translated as "2/3 or more" of the deposit-weighted percentage
    of the total deposit size of all validators in a set.

  The best-known fault-tolerant consensus algorithm is Paxos;
  it was first published by Lamport  in  1998. Since then, many
  variations  have  been  developed  (e.g.Fast Paxos" ) so there
  is now a whole family of Paxos algorithms,  including some that
  are BFT
   Mike Burrows of Google (co-inventor of Google's Chubby,
  BigTable, and Dapper) has said,  "There is only one consensus protocol,
  and that's Paxos,"  [30] and all working protocols for asynchronous
  consensus we have so far encountered have Paxos at their
  core."
   Henry Robinson of Cloudera has said, "all other approaches are
  just broken versions of Paxos" and it's clear that a good consensus
  protocol is surprisingly hard to find."

  has the efect of being merged [83].  SuperNET [96] and Ethereum's hypercubes
  and multichain proposals [97]  fit in this category. However, if the goal
  is simply to get a DB to run at scale, breaking the DB into many

  and introduces risk.
  """Proposed solution: In order to transfer asset provide proof/s of possesion

      then create a TXs on the second (side) blockchain whose inputs contain a

-ºSidechainº is a blockchain that validates data from other blockchains

-ºTwo-way pegº: Mechanism by which coins are transferred between sidechains

-ºDMMSº: Dynamic membership multi-party signature: Signature formed by a set of
  signers which has no fixed size. Bitcoin's blockheaders can be considered
  DMMSes because their proof-of-work has the property that anyone can contribute
  with no enrolment process

-ºSimplified payment verification proof(SPV)º is a DMMS that an action 
  occurred on a Bitcoin-kie proof-of-work blockchain
  - To transfer parent chain coins into sidechain coins, the parent chain coins are
   sent to a special output on the parent chain that can only be unlocked by an SPV
   proof of possession on the sidechain. To sync the two chains two waiting periods
   are needed:
  - ºConfirmation periodº of a transfer between sidechains: duration for which a coin
      must be locked on the parent chain before it can be transferred to the sidechain,
      allowing for sufficient work to be created sucha that a denial of service attack
      in the next waiting period becomes more difficult (around 1 or 2 days).
      The user waits for the conf. period, then creates a TX on the sidechain refering
      to this output, providing an SPV proof that it was created and "buried" under
      sufficient work on the parent chain.
  - ºContest periodº delta-time in which a newly-transferred coin main
      not be spent on the sidechain in order to prevent double-spending by transferring
      previously-locked coins during a reorganization. ("in the order of one/two days)
  - While locked on the parent chain, the coin can be freely transferred within 
      the sidechain without  further interaction with the parent chain. However, it 
      retains its identity as a parent chain coin, and can only be transferred 
      back to the same chain that it came from.
  - Transfering coinx back from the side chain to the parent chain follows the
      same procedure: send the sidechain coins to an SPV-locked output, produce a 
      sufficient SPV proof that this was done, and use the proof to unlock a number
      of previosly-locked outputs with equal denomination on the parent chain.

  - Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude.
    Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.
  - Low Cost. By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network 
    allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such 
    as instant micropayments.
  - Cross Blockchains. Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly 
    with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. So long as the chains can

 , and divisive hard forks can become a thing of the past.
 ... it has the potential to integrate so called "private" chains into
the same consensus network as public chains like Ethereum - while still
retaining their privacy and permissioned safeguards. It gives us a new
transactive layer potentially linking hundreds of blockchains to one
another." 
    
 - Polkadot has been designated to include a backwards-compatibility
layer with the current Ethereum network, allowing smart contracts on
Ethereum to interact directly with any chains that become a part

<span xsmall>Characterizing Payments in Bitcoin</span>
<a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf">Ref</a>
Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either phys-
ical  commodities  or  sovereign  obligation;  instead,  it  relies  on  a
combination of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer proto-
col for witnessing settlements.  Consequently, Bitcoin has the un-
intuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly
anonymous, its flow is globally visible.  In this paper we explore
this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group
Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then us-
ing re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and
services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this anal-
ysis,  we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market,
the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the chal-
lenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent
purposes at scale.

<span xsmall>correlation</span>
@[http://www.jgriffin.info/papers/]
This paper investigates whether Tether, a digital 
currency pegged to U.S.  dollars, influences Bitcoin and 
other cryptocurrency prices during the recent boom. Using 
algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that 
purchases with Tether are timed following market 
downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin 
prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tether 
transactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise 
in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryptocurrencies. The 
flow clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric 
autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests incomplete 
Tether backing before month-ends. These patterns cannot 
be explained by investor demand proxies but are most 
consistent with the supply-based hypothesis where Tether 
is used to provide price support and manipulate 
cryptocurrency prices.

<span xsmall>Stable Coins</span>
<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/04/01/announcing-world-trade-francs-official-ethereum-stablecoin/">From</a>:
"""
We have long recognized that in order for cryptocurrency 
to reach mass adoption, a form of cryptocurrency that has 
higher price stability than existing cryptocurrencies 
like BTC and ETH would be needed so that people can use 
the currency to store funds and engage in commerce 
without worrying about their monthly salary dropping by 57
% between the time they receive it and the time they can 
use the money to buy products. Unfortunately, we’ve found 
that the existing stablecoins all have various flaws; 
Tether is unauditable, Nubits has already once collapsed 
in price, Seignorage Shares is after three years still 
just a whitepaper and MakerDAO is an inadequate joke 
because…. reasons. As a result, we’ve decided to take 
matters into our own hands, and issue our own officially 
branded stablecoin, and use this as an opportunity to 
make another ICO"""

<span xsmall>Exchange</span>
<span xsmall>attacks</span>
Examples:
   """In the past few weeks, we’ve seen reports of consensus attacks on large crypto projects such 
  as Verge (XVG) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG). We faced some consensus attacks as well. These attacks are 
  known as double-spends. Here’s how they work:

1) An attacker sends a transaction.

2) The attacker mines blocks on a chain with his/her own 
or rented hashpower (usually by forking off), but refuses 
to broadcast these blocks on the network. These blocks do 
not contain his/her original transaction from step 1.

3) The attacker’s transaction is confirmed on a service (
like an exchange), so he/she gets credited for the 
transaction.

4) The attacker broadcasts the blocks on the network, 
erasing the existence of his or her transaction. Now he 
or she has been credited coins on the service he/she sent 
to and he/she still has the coins.

Our new Komodo notarization feature greatly reduces the 
impact of such an attack. Komodo notaries are running 
GameCredits clients and monitoring the network 24/7/365. 
At a certain interval of blocks, these notaries get the 
hash of a block and write it into the Komodo chain. They 
also note down which Komodo block has the notarization 
within the GameCredits chain."""

  ººHOW IT WORKSºº
    - Register an event to track using public API.
    - We issue two Reality Keys ™, one for Yes and one for No. 
    - We keep the private keys and publish the public keys,
       which you can use to create an encrypted message or a Bitcoin contract.
    - For users of Ethereum and other advanced smart contract platforms,
      we provide a hash that will identify the result, and an address
      that we will use to sign it.
    - We wait until the date you specified when you created the fact.
    - We perform an automated check against the appropriate API and publish the result.
    - In the event that anyone thinks the result from the API was wrong, 
      they can pay us a fee and a human will double-check.
      Otherwise the result provided by the API will stand.
    - We publish the private key for the winning result. 
      You can use it to decrypt your message or complete a
      Bitcoin contract. The private key for the losing result is never released.
    - We also sign the value (either true/false or the value of
      the data we find) with our Ethereum address, allowing it to be used in an Ethereum contract.

"If your business uses a blockchain to validate your data and your competitor doesn’t, what exactly is the difference? The difference is that you are providing a level of security that guarantees the ability to trust your digital infrastructure, at any time—without relying on any one person, machine, or partner organization. Industrial organizations looking to add premium offerings are going to be deploying blockchain-based solutions, and pricing their services accordingly.
A trust relationship without measurable proof usually takes years to build, but only a second to destroy. A blockchain can strengthen a brand by providing verifiable data integrity to customers. This is a matter of conditional trust versus unconditional trust. People can relate to and comprehend conditional trust because they can see and measure it. But unconditional trust depends on personal belief systems (for example, faith in the person or organization you are dealing with) and personal experience built up over a long time."

(6) Serializability isolation, ACID:
Blockchain trans-
actions require serializable isolation, in which dirty read,
non-repeatable read, phantom reads, and serialization anoma-
lies are not possible. Transactions, when executed in paral-
lel, must follow the same serializable order across all nodes.
Further, transactions should be ACID [18] compliant. Seri-
alizable isolation can be achieved in databases by employing:
(i) strict 2-phase locking [32], (ii) optimistic concurrency
control [28], or (iii) SSI [19, 36]. This needs to be enhanced
to follow the block order as determined through consensus,
but can be leveraged to a large extent.
