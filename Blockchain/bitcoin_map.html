Thecnically, a Bitcoin address is the hash of the elliptic curve public key, and not the public key
itself. However, it is in fact perfectly legitimate cryptographic terminology to
refer to the pubkey hash as a public key itself. This is because Bitcoin's cryptography can be
considered to be a custom digital signature algorithm, where the public key consists of the hash 
of the ECC pubkey, the signature consists of the ECC pubkey concatenated with the ECC signature,
and the verification algorithm involves checking the ECC pubkey in the signature against the ECC
pubkey hash provided as a public key and then verifying the ECC signature against the ECC pubkey.

<span xsmall>Metacoins</span>

- The idea behind a metacoin is to have a protocol that lives on top 
  of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin transactions to store metacoin transactions 
  but having a different state transition function, APPLY'(S,TX).

- Because the metacoin protocol cannot prevent invalid metacoin 
  transactions from appearing in the Bitcoin blockchain, a rule is added:

  if APPLY'(S,TX) returns an error, 
  the protocol defaults to APPLY'(S,TX) = S.

  This provides and easy mechanism for creating an arbitray cryptocurrency
  protocol, potentially with advanced features that cannot be implemented
  inside of Bitcoin itself, but with a very low devlopment cost since the
  complexities of mining and networking are already handled by the Bitcoin
  protocol.

""""
  Built upon and extending Bitcoin\u2019s codebase, it lets developers familiar
  with the bitcoind API to quickly and cost-effectively create working
  blockchains and test proof-of-concept projects. Being built on the Bitcoin
  codebase also allows Elements to function as a testbed for changes
  to the Bitcoin protocol itself.
